0,0,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party targeting opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week long election.\n\nThe videos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India\'s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups.\n\nThe Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video has been shared ""clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions"".\n\nA set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibit them from creating ""mutual hatred"" between caste, religious or linguistic groups.\n\nManipulated videos on social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticizing the prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'"

Congress has fielded the points-person of the Gandhis in the twin constituencies, Kishori Lal Sharma, as its candidate from Amethi against Smriti Irani who gave a shock defeat to Rahul in 2019.\n\nFormer J&K CM and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah is in the fray from Baramulla. Independent candidate Abdul Rashid Sheikh, known popularly as Engineer Rashid, is said to be putting up a good fight against Abdullah and People's Conference leader Sajad Lone in this triangular contest. Rashid is in jail under UAPA. In Ladakh, BJP replaced sitting MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal with Tashi Gyalson as its candidate this time.\n\nSome of the seats going to polls in Bihar are being keenly watched. After winning the Saran seat in 2014 and 2019, Rudy is in the fray again but the battle is tougher this time as he is pitted against Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya, who had gained a lot of sympathy for donating her kidney to her ailing father.\n\nChirag Paswan is contesting from Hajipur as LJP (RV) candidate under the NDA umbrella. He has moved to his father Ram Vilas Paswan's erstwhile seat from Jamui which he won in 2014 and 2019. A win will establish Chirag's status as the inheritor of his father's legacy. RJD candidate Shiv Chandra Ram is putting up a good fight but Chirag is likely to sail through.\n\nAmong the 13 seats of Maharashtra going to polls, Goyal is contesting from Mumbai North. Former public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam is BJP nominee from Mumbai North Central, replacing sitting MP Poonam Mahajan. Chief minister Eknath Shinde's son Srikant is contesting from Kalyan. Union minister Bharati Pawar is reportedly in a tough contest in Dindori (ST) seat.\n\nThe five seats of Odisha going to polls include Bolangir. Former minister Jual Oram will try to retain the Sundargarh (ST) seat again.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Faizabad MP Lallu Singh will try to retain his seat with BJP banking on the consecration of Ram temple for his victory. In Kaiserganj, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who is embroiled in the sexual harassment case filed by top women wrestlers, managed to get BJP ticket for his son Karan as his replacement.\n\nIn West Bengal, Locket Chatterjee (Hooghly) is fighting against CPM candidate Manadip Ghosh; AITC's Prasun Banerjee is contesting against Rathin Chakravarty of BJP in Howrah."""

""The CCL (Child in Conflict with Law) will write an essay of 300 words on the topic of road accidents and their solutions,"" the official order of JJ board said.\n\n""The order passed by the JJ Board was shocking and surprising as it had taken a very lenient view of such a heinous crime. The Pune police had petitioned the board to allow them to treat the teenager as an adult as his age is 17 years and eight months. But the board kept the application aside by categorising it as \'seen and filed\' and released him on bail which led to public outrage,"" said Fadnavis.\n\nThe accused juvenile along with his friends went to two hotels between 9.30 pm and 1 am and allegedly consumed liquor, according to police.

5,5,"b'NEW DELHI: BJP leader and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday wondered whether the Congress is aware of the cost of implementing the social welfare schemes, including giving Rs 1 lakh to women belonging to below poverty line families. A lot has been said in recent times about the fiscal management (especially on debt) of our government under PM Modi\'s leadership, Sitharaman said in a post on X.\n\n""Many times, absolute numbers have been compared without considering the GDP growth on which we base the debt calculation. I would like to put out a clear picture, unlike @INCIndia, which hides behind lofty promises that are non-transparent and disconnected from reality,"" it said.\n\n""Has @INCIndia considered the cost of the lofty promises made in their manifesto? Have they calculated how much the \'Khata Khat\' schemes will cost fiscally? Will they borrow substantially for them, or will they raise taxes to fund them?"" it said.\n\nShe wondered how many welfare schemes would Rahul Gandhi shut down to accommodate the fiscal cost of the \'khata khat\' schemes.\n\nLast month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while addressing a poll rally made a poll promise saying that the party will transfer Rs 1 lakh in the account of one woman from every poor household in the country if they win the elections.\n\n""Would @RahulGandhi care to answer these real questions and explain how their gigantic schemes of fiscal splurge would work without increasing taxes or borrowing heavily and running down the economy? Here\'s a challenge to him to answer these questions for the people of India,"" she said.\n\nThe truth is that the BJP government\'s fiscal management is much better than that of the UPA, despite facing Covid-19 pandemic in which substantial resources were used for relief efforts, the FM said.\n\nDuring the UPA rule from FY04 to FY14, she said, central government debt, including external debt at current values, grew about 3.2 times, from Rs 18.74 lakh crore in March 2004 to Rs 58.59 lakh crore in March 2014.\n\nThis increase was much greater than the 2.9 times growth from Rs 58.59 lakh crore in FY14 to Rs 172.37 lakh crore in FY24 (RE), she said, adding, this lower increase between FY 2014 and FY 2024 occurred despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, where the Centre borrowed to provide relief to those in need even as revenues fell.\n\nThe central government\'s debt, which was 52.2 per cent of the GDP at the end of 2013-14, was reduced to around 48.9 per cent in 2018-19 through gradual fiscal consolidation.\n\nDuring this period, the fiscal deficit was lowered from 4.5 per cent in FY14 to 3.4 per cent in FY19.\n\nHowever, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and proactive government measures to protect lives and livelihoods, the fiscal deficit surged to 9.2 per cent of the GDP in 2020-21, increasing the central government\'s debt to 61.4 per cent of the GDP.\n\nPost-pandemic, Modi-led government pursued a balanced approach to fiscal consolidation while sustaining economic growth. This strategy reduced the fiscal deficit from 9.2 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 to 5.8 per cent in the Revised Estimates for FY24.\n\nThe Interim Budget projects a further reduction to 5.1 per cent of GDP in FY25. Similarly, the central government\'s debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 61.4 per cent in 2020-21 to 57.1 per cent in 2023-24.\n\nThe Net Market Borrowings (G-sec) of the Centre had gone up a whopping 4.5 times during the UPA regime, she said, adding, ""it went up 2.6 times under our government despite the Covid-19 pandemic"".\n\n""It shows the robust fiscal management of our government,"" she added.\n\nUnder the Congress-led UPA government, she said, the underlying deficit was much higher than the budgeted deficit.\n\nObserving that the UPA government did ""window dressing"" to hide its high fiscal deficit without maintaining the integrity of the fiscal numbers, she said, fiscal deficit for 2008-09 would have been 7.9 per cent instead of 6.1 per cent as officially stated.\n\nThe UPA government issued special bonds in lieu of cash subsidies to the Oil Marketing Companies (oil bonds), fertiliser companies, and FCI to keep the official deficit numbers lower, she said.\n\n""Over Rs 1.9 lakh crore was kept off the books in the five years from FY06 to FY10. Including these off-budget borrowings would have severely increased the fiscal and revenue deficit numbers,"" she said.\n\nShe further said UPA excelled in policy misadventures and scams like CWG, Antrix-Devas, Coal and Telecom spectrum allocation scams caused huge losses to the exchequer.\n\nThere was unsustainable demand stimulus post-2008, unproductive government borrowings, ill-targeted subsidies and government schemes were further marred with corruption and leakages, she said.\n\nMoreover, she said, ""due to the rigorous implementation of DBT, we have saved Rs 3.5 lakh crore from leakages and corruption"".\n\nHighlighting a cross-country comparison, she said it reveals that India has fared relatively well and maintains a general government-debt ratio below that of FY03.\n\n""India had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 81 per cent in 2022. This is significantly lower than economies like Japan (260.1 per cent), Italy (140.5 per cent), the US (121.3 per cent), France (111.8 per cent), and the UK (101.9 per cent) in the same period. On the other hand, several countries have faced the risk of sovereign default in recent years,"" she said.\n\nThe number of countries facing high debt levels increased from 22 in 2011 to almost 60 in 2022.\n\nRegarding central government debt, she said, it is also important to note that it is overwhelmingly rupee-denominated, with external borrowings (from bilateral and multilateral sources) contributing a minimal amount (less than 5 per cent of total debt), which signifies that exposure to volatility in exchange rates tend to be on the lower end.'"

The Congress-ruled states including Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have committed the crime and sin of robbing the rights of OBC by providing reservation to minorities from their shares,"" Chouhan charged.\n\nHe alleged that while the Congress did not give Constitutional status to the OBC Commission for about 40 years, its government committed the ""sin"" of ending the reservation for Dalits, OBCs and tribals in the educational institutions like the Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh and Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi.\n\n""Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar once said at Rally in Punjab that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru did not do anything for Dalits and backwards.

Speaking with a group of select journalists in Pune, Sitharaman pointed out that the police report has been filed in a Congress-ruled state. ""The closure report says he had a wrong certificate of SC (Scheduled Caste), and he was not an SC. But, the family of Vemula was dragged and exhibited in the country when it was grieving. The Congress, by dragging the family of Vemula in the public, tried to politicise the issue.

""He should also apologise to the SC community for misusing (them). It was not a Dalit issue but (Gandhi) made it look like a Dalit issue. Now he is running \'Mohabbat ki Dukan\', but back then he was running \'toxic dukan\', and for that he should apologise,"" she added. Later, speaking on \'the role of higher education in realising the vision of \'viksit Bharat\'\' at Deccan College in the city and interacting with the students after the talk, Sitharaman said the University of Hyderabad was not allowed to handle the issue with sensitivity.\n\nA narrative was built that the government is suppressive, against students and against SCs, she claimed, adding, ""today the same people, who dragged that unfortunate family to the street, should stand up before the entire country and apologise for having politicised the incident."" The wrong narrative came from ""vested interest groups, self-appointed left liberal group, self-appointed leader in the opposition, who says \'mohabbat ki dukan\',"" she said. ""He actually perpetrated this problem, spoke so badly in Parliament about his interpretation (of the incident),"" Sitharaman alleged.\n\nWhen she said that rigorous research will have to be done with methodology, with data and without getting confused with the political narrative, this was what she meant, the minister told the students. ""The problem which could have been addressed amicably within the university, without dishonoring any particular student or family, was dragged to the streets of the country and allegations were levied against then education minister and central government as it was a central university,"" she said. The intolerance, political interference and hate lay not with the government but the vested interest groups which ""do not lose an opportunity to bring this toxin into centres of higher education,"" Sitharaman claimed.

Addressing an election rally at Darbhanga, Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat where riots had erupted after the incident, also alleged that the RJD supremo had acted in connivance with the Congress, which headed the UPA, in power at the Centre.\n\nThis is probably the first time Modi raised the Godhra issue during the ongoing elections.\n\nWithout mentioning Prasad by name, Modi described the RJD supremo, who was the Railway minister in the first UPA government, as one ""serving sentences, out on bail (in fodder scam cases)"".\n\n""He had tried to shield those who were responsible for the Godhra train burning incident in which more than 60 kar sevaks were burnt alive. Was it not the reign of Sonia (Gandhi) madam"", remarked PM, referring to the former Congress president and UPA chairperson.\n\nModi recalled that the Banerjee Commission, although headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, was often called ""ben raazi (the sister is willing)"", and ""under pressure"" from Prasad it submitted a ""bogus"" report that ""tried to exonerate those who were guilty and put the blame on kar sevaks themselves"".\n\n""But the court consigned the report to the dustbin. Those who were guilty got punished, some of them even getting death sentences,"" said the prime minister.\n\nModi alleged that all constituents of the opposition bloc INDIA had a propensity towards ""appeasement"" and lambasted the RJD for ""counting Muslims among armed forces"".\n\nThe remark seemed an oblique reference to Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD president\'s son and heir apparent who has spoken of ""all the three armed forces being headed by Hindus"" while slamming the ruling BJP at the Centre for repeatedly claiming that the faith of the majority community was ""in danger"".\n\nIn his speech which lasted for more than 30 minutes, Modi also took potshots at Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, mentioning neither by name but observing ""there is a \'shehzada\' (crown prince) in Delhi. Likewise there is a \'shehzada\' in Patna. Both have had a dismal track record"".\n\n""Their tendency for appeasement makes them behave in this fashion. Earlier, they had insulted the armed forces by raising questions on surgical strikes. We never think in terms of Hindus and Muslims while talking about our armed forces and our martyrs,"" the prime minister said.\n\nModi also alleged that in 2007, when Prasad was the railway minister, ""he had advocated reservations for Muslims"" and that the RJD supremo and Congress ""want to divert quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs, who feel disillusionment towards them"".\n\n""These parties are going against Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar and even Jawaharlal Nehru, both of whom were opposed to reservations along religious lines...... but let me assure you, as long as Modi is alive, nobody can snatch away reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs,"" said the PM at the rally here.\n\nSlamming the INDIA bloc for ""spreading lies that I want to change the Constitution, which I worship"", Modi said, ""I have been challenging them for 12 days to give in writing that they will not snatch away quotas meant for deprived people and provide these along religious lines. They are yet to do so"".\n\nThe prime minister also noted that the Mithila region, named after an ancient kingdom of which Darbhanga was the capital, was the land of Goddess Sita, and therefore, had special sentiments for Ram temple at Ayodhya.\n\n""India was first attacked on its western boundary about 1,000 years ago. It led to a millennium of enslavement. When we freed Ayodhya after a nearly-500-year-long fight, I had said that for the next 1,000 years, India will script a new history,"" said Modi who also asserted that the country had begun to get its rightful place in the comity of nations.\n\n""When bad days fell on the nation, Bihar was among the worst sufferers. We must not allow the state to return to the era of the lantern"", said Modi, referring to the RJD\'s poll symbol.\n\nHe also made an indirect reference to the land-for-jobs scam under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate in which Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Yadav have been named, saying ""the people of Bihar have been made to do away with their land to get jobs"".\n\n""The people of Bihar must also not forgive constituents of the INDIA bloc, which ruled Delhi and Maharashtra when mass exodus of labourers took place during the COVID pandemic"", asserted the prime minister.\n\nHe also lauded ally Nitish Kumar, the Bihar chief minister who heads the JD(U), for his governance track record.\n\nModi added, ""We had been occupying the 11th spot among economies of the world. Now we are the fifth largest economy"".\n\nReferring to the ""inheritance tax"" controversy, the prime minister alleged that ""the Congress wants to bring in a law by which one will be deprived of 55 per cent of whatever one\'s parents have earned and saved. They wish to place a fatwa on one\'s inheritance"".\n\nIn keeping with his penchant for connecting with locals wherever he goes, the prime minister addressed the rally wearing the traditional headgear ""Mithila paag"", on which the lotus, the BJP\'s poll symbol, was printed.\n\nHe also took note of an enthusiastic supporter who brought a cut-out of the PM to the venue.\n\n""I appreciate that you have made Modi dance.

Taking a dig at his rival, he said she is on a month-long political tourism and would pack up and return to Bollywood after June 4.\n\nReturning the salvo, Kangana dubbed Vikramaditya as ""Chhota Pappu"". It was a mocking reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who is often dubbed as ""Pappu"" or a novice by his political opponents. Kangana called Vikramaditya a ""junior Pappu"".\n\nShe asked him why he stood mum when Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu took ""anti-Mandi decisions"" like stalling the Rs 250- crore Shiv Dhan project, curtailing the jurisdiction of Mandi University and pushing the Sundernagar airfield project under the carpet.\n\nKangana\'s main agendas include restarting all the stalled projects besides improving connectivity to remote tribal areas, and popularising local cuisines and traditional attires, and promoting women-centric rural tourism in Seraj and Karsog.\n\n""Mandi will be made a smart city,"" this is my promise, said Vikramaditya, adding that Jalori Jot tunnel will be constructed on the line of Rohtang tunnel and remote Pangi area of Chamba will be connected with Tissa, besides the construction of Beas river front.\n\nThe alleged insulting remarks by Kangana on farmers during the farmer agitation are recoiling and the Samyukt Kisan Manch has rendered their support to Vikramaditya.\n\nOn the other hand, Kangana got support from unexpected quarters.

Singh retaliated by saying she will return ""purified"" from the \'Dev bhoomi\'.\n\nBoth Bollywood reel \'Queen\' Kangana and \'Raja\' Vikramaditya Singh have declared their assets over of Rs 90 crore.

""Modi ji is a king, I am telling the truth,"" Gandhi said.\n\n""He is not the prime minister, he is a king. He has nothing to do with the Cabinet, Parliament or the Constitution.

He warns that imposing a wealth tax could lead to the emigration of India\'s super-rich to tax havens like Dubai, resulting in a substantial loss of wealth for the country. Sen also questions the feasibility of implementing an inheritance tax and emphasizes the need for stable governance to sustain India\'s economic growth.Economist Gautam Sen has criticized Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s proposal for wealth redistribution in India, stating that it is impractical and would lead to severe economic consequences. Sen argues that the proposal would require liquidating businesses owned by individuals with wealth exceeding 102 crores each, which would bring the economy to a standstill. He further contends that the tax generated from such measures would not significantly benefit the majority of the population. Sen emphasizes that India has already experienced significant redistribution through economic growth over the past decade.\n\nIn an interview with ANI, on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s idea of redistribution of wealth, economist Gautam Sen says, ""...It won\'t work in India...As I said, only about 12 crore people have wealth in the excess of 102 crores each. But almost all of these have invested in their businesses. So, you will have to liquidate their businesses in order to take away their wealth...Economy will come to a halt...My argument is that the total amount of tax you will generate from taking everything away from anybody who has something which is less than one and a half percent of population will not make the remaining 98-99% better off. They would simply suffer...Bear in mind, you will have to do this survey every two years...We have better redistribution in the last 10 years from growth, from real goods...""\n\nSen, who formerly served as a member of the Indo-UK Roundtable and Senior Consultant at UNDP, noted that only about 12 crore people in India possess wealth exceeding 102 crores each, with the majority having invested in their businesses.\n\nSen argued that implementing such a policy would necessitate the liquidation of businesses, resulting in an economic standstill and negative repercussions for small and medium industries, which are the largest employers outside of agriculture. He also questioned the efficacy of such a measure, stating that the total tax generated from redistributing wealth from a small percentage of the population would not significantly benefit the remainder of the population.\n\n""The very rich, that is the Ambanis, the Adanis, the Mahindras, the Tatas, and I presume not more than 500 or less of the very rich, the billionaire class, they will emigrate from India to Dubai. Most Indian millionaires who have been leaving the country have gone to Dubai, 70 per cent in fact, because Dubai has no income tax. And they will re-register their businesses in UAE, which means India will only be able to collect corporate taxes from them because their business will remain in India,"" Sen said.\n\nHe said, ""So there will be a huge loss of wealth to India. Now, if you think about other countries, Sweden used to have a very significant inheritance tax. And Sweden is one of the highest tax countries in the world in history. But you know, Sweden removed the inheritance tax because many of the rich were fleeing. For example, the owner of IKEA had migrated out of Sweden.""\n\n""And what they found after removing inheritance tax, that a lot of the wealth came back, economic growth improved, and tax collecting also improved. So with that extra taxes, they could redistribute to the less well-off in Sweden. So, in fact, not having inheritance tax or wealth tax was beneficial to the ordinary Sweden. Now, in India, if you inflict this amount of chaos, you must bear in mind you can\'t do it to agricultural land"", the economist said.\n\nRegarding Congress leader Sam Pitroda\'s proposal to adopt an inheritance tax akin to that in the US, Sen pointed out that India\'s circumstances differ from those of the US in this regard. He highlighted the potential loss of wealth to India if the country\'s wealthiest individuals, such as Ambani, Adani, and Tata, were to move to tax havens like Dubai.\n\n""The US example is not a good analogy for India at all. The issue is like this. Re-distribution is something that takes place in all economies, and all societies. In fact, the redistribution that happened in India in the last 10 years hasn\'t happened in a thousand years. We\'ve had massive increases in the welfare of rural India for the first time. And the poorest parts of India have also improved their relative status. So actually in India, we are doing well. The question is, how do you achieve this? The proposal made to survey all households and businesses is impractical for many reasons.""\n\nSen referenced Sweden\'s experience with inheritance tax, noting that its abolition resulted in increased economic growth and wealth retention. He stressed that redistribution occurs naturally in all economies and societies, noting significant improvements in the welfare of rural areas and the poorest sections of society in India over the past decade.\n\nSen said, ""...But almost all of this is invested in their businesses. So you will have to liquidate their businesses in order to take away their wealth. So your local shopkeeper, your... Local store, your repair shop, all of this will be worth Rs 5 crore, maybe Rs 10 crore, maximum less.""\n\nHe further added, ""All of these people will have to surrender everything they have. Now, the economy will come to a halt. But even if that were not the case, consider the biggest single employer outside agriculture in India is small and medium industry. These people have one big problem in India that the government is trying to solve, which is they have cash flow problem. They receive their income in the future and to pay their expenses up front.""\n\n""These people will try to find as much as they can from their cash flow to meet the demands of an inheritance tax, which means they really will not be able to operate at all. But even that will not be enough. My argument is that the total amount of tax you will generate from taking everything away from anybody who has something that is less than 1.5 per cent of the population will not make the remaining 98, 99 per cent better off. They will simply suffer within the next six months. And bear in mind, you will have to do this survey every year for every two years to see how the wealth distribution is"", Sen said\n\nSen also expressed doubts about the practicality of implementing an inheritance tax and the proposal to survey all households and businesses. He highlighted that only a small percentage of people in India pay personal income tax, and redistributing wealth from this group would have minimal impact on overall wealth distribution.\n\nIn conclusion, Sen emphasized the importance of stable governance to sustain India\'s economic growth and prosperity. He expressed optimism about India\'s economic future, provided there is consistent and prudent governance in place.\n\n(With inputs from ANI)'"

78,78,"b'Wealth redistribution - an idea mooted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and rebuked by India\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi as \'dangerous\' - has rattled the political arena in the world\'s largest democracy, which is nearing the end of a weeks-long election battle to cherry pick the next government.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi vowed that if the Congress wins this year\'s Lok Sabha elections, the party would conduct a survey to assess who possesses most wealth in the country and take steps to redistribute it. However, PM Modi stirred controversy by suggesting in a campaign speech that if the Congress were to come into power, it would redistribute wealth to Muslims. He cited former PM Manmohan Singh\'s statement, suggesting that the minority community had priority access to the nation\'s resources.\n\nClick here to participate in our Lok Sabha Elections Survey to gauge the mood of the nation\n\nThe political slugfest became more intense when Sam Pitroda, former chairman of Indian Overseas Congress, explained Congress\' rationale behind the wealth redistribution idea that sparked fear that 50% of wealth should go to the public. He fuelled the controversy by proposing inheritance tax as a way to redistribute wealth. Pitroda later clarified his stance. He said: ""Who said 55% will be taken away? Who said something like this should be done in India ? Why is BJP and media in panic?""\n\nCongress had distanced itself from Pitroda\'s comments.\n\nNonetheless, the wealth redistribution row has hardly left the Lok Sabha election campaign stage. While it became a \'hot topic\' for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to trade barbs against Congress amid election heat, the Grand Old Party and its leaders, from Rahul Gandhi to Jairam Ramesh, defended the idea and what is represented.\n\nAlso Read: Wealth redistribution: The economics behind Rahul Gandhi\'s \'Robin Hood\' idea\n\nWealth distribution a key agenda to swing votes?\n\nWhile it may have started off as a fight to swing votes, a new study suggested India should impose wealth tax on the ultra-rich to tackle wealth inequality.\n\nAlso Read: Study suggests India should impose wealth tax on the ultra-rich to tackle wealth inequality\n\nBut what is more interesting, is the lead author of a report from World Inequality Lab, which suggested imposition of a wealth tax to correct inequalities in India, said there will be no vote-bank threat if a tax is imposed on the assets of the wealthy, as it will not impact 99.96% of the population.\n\n""Since the proposed tax does not impact 99.96% of the population, there is no vote bank threat. On the issue of trusts, a lot of improvement is required to fully design the taxation,"" said Nitin Kumar Bharti, the lead author of the World Inequality Lab report.\n\nWill wealth tax debate have a plain-vanilla end?\n\nWhile experts say that its impact can only be on negligible sections of the society, politicians won\'t necessarily drop it as an agenda for political debates.\n\nThe Congress party has suggested reallocating some resources to traditionally marginalised economic and caste-based communities. But, Modi and the BJP have accused the opposition of plotting to transfer wealth from Hindu households to Muslims.\n\nThat shows it is a trump card when the political leaders are delivering their speeches to masses attending political rallies or even those sitting at the comfort of the home watching the news or campaign speeches either on their iPhones or a simple smartphone (hinting at K-shaped recovery? We will come to that).\n\nAlso Read: Economist Gautam Sen gives \'12 crore\' reasons why Rahul Gandhi\'s wealth distribution plan won\'t work in India\n\nFor an issue that hogged such political limelight, it would look like a plain-vanilla end to the controversy if it isn\'t affecting the vote bank.\n\nWhile India is now the world\'s most populous country, the percentage of citizens filing income tax returns have also surged - indicating rising wealth. However, just 2.2% of the adult population in India are income tax payers, which is 88 crore people approximately, according to ToI. Out of that, imagine the miniscule percentage of ultra-rich filing tax.\n\nHow many ultra-rich are in India?\n\nA new study co-authored by economist Thomas Piketty reveals that 0.04% of the adult population holds more than a quarter of the total wealth. Imposing this tax would only affect this small fraction, leaving 99.96% of adults unaffected.\n\nThe paper, released on May 24, proposed imposing a 2% annual tax on net wealth exceeding Rs 10 crore, along with a 33% inheritance tax on estates exceeding Rs 10 crore in valuation. According to the paper, this could generate revenue equivalent to 2.73% of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nWhat this perhaps suggests is that truly the number of votes that can swing from the wealth distribution won\'t be much, unless the political bickery is strong enough and is definitely a big asset for the campaigners.\n\nThe Congress party has accused the Modi government of engaging in \'crony capitalism\' by favoring certain businesses in government contracts. In response, the government has denied these accusations, asserting that it has not shown favoritism to companies and has instead focused on investing in welfare programs to improve the lives of the poor.\n\nNow coming to the K-shaped recovery claim and inequality aspect, which is said to be the crux of Congress\' wealth redistribution idea.\n\nMore than political, isn\'t it about inequality?\n\nRahul Gandhi\'s plan may sound like a simple \'Robin Hood\' scheme to take from the rich and give the poor, but the idea of wealth redistribution has been debated for quite some time. Historically central to communist revolutions, wealth redistribution is now discussed by economists due to rising income inequality.\n\nGovernment policies already include basic redistributive principles, like progressive taxation where the rich pay more taxes, and subsidies or freebies for the poor, such as free food grains. However, there has been a call for more radical measures.\n\nThe World Inequality Lab reported that inequality in India has widened since the early 2000s, with the income and wealth share of the top 1% of the population rising to 22.6% and 40.1%, respectively, in 2022-23.\n\nIndia\'s top 1% income share is among the highest in the world, surpassing even South Africa, Brazil, and the US, according to the report.\n\nRajesh Shukla, MD-CEO, People\'s Research on India\'s Consumer Economy, wrote in ET editorial that since 1947, India has experienced significant economic growth, but the benefits have been unevenly distributed. Economic liberalisation brought new opportunities and wealth, but it also increased inequality. Recent economic disruptions, including the pandemic, have further exacerbated this trend.\n\nRead Rajesh Shukla\'s full article here\n\nSome experts believe progressive taxation and increased social spending present alternative solutions to enhance economic equality. Wealth taxes like capital income taxation, net wealth taxation, and transfer taxation could generate additional tax revenue. This revenue could then be allocated towards investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\n\nBut to be sure, India had previously implemented taxes targeting the wealthy, such as estate tax, wealth tax, and gift tax. However, these taxes were eventually abolished due to low collections and high administrative costs.\n\nDid India\'s previous experiments with wealth tax succeed?\n\nPM Modi had said that concepts like wealth redistribution and wealth tax often don\'t solve poverty but rather spread it out, making everyone equally poor. He described these ideas as disguised problems, not real solutions. ""Would you keep working hard if the government took away your money in the name of redistribution?"" he questioned.\n\nPM Modi also said that wealth redistribution could discourage many people who are striving to lift themselves out of poverty with the government\'s support.\n\nEventually, as India deals with the challenges of wealth inequality, the conversation keeps going. Even though political talk may calm down as election heat fades, the main problem stays, and it needs careful thought and strong action to make sure everyone has a fair shot at a better future.'"

86,86,"b'Thiruvananthapuram: Unprecedented climate change disasters - prolonged heatwaves, flash floods, drought, agricultural devastation and landslides - are affecting people in India. As 968 million people head to polling booths across the nation, the Election Commission of India is going to great lengths to ensure that a \'green election\' is conducted.\n\nIn the southern state of Kerala, for instance, the commission collaborated with the Local Self Government Department to ensure plastic-free polling, with election officials served tea in steel mugs instead of the standard paper cups with a thin plastic coating.\n\nHowever, this attention to detail isn\'t matched by political parties contesting the election. Or by voters, who don\'t seem to care about climate change.\n\nThe CSDS-Lokniti 2024 pre-poll survey indicates that Indian voters are primarily concerned with unemployment and inflation.\n\nA detailed review of the election manifestos revealed that, except for the regional party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), none of the major political parties in India have concrete grassroots-level plans to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nIndia\'s electoral scene features only a modest and oblique reflection of issues related to climate change.\n\nIn forest-adjoining areas throughout the country, it\'s increasingly common for wild animals to enter human settlements and cause damage. This is mostly caused by food and water shortages in summer and alterations in wildlife habitats because of climate change.\n\nIn the Wayanad constituency where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting, human-wildlife conflicts have already become a hot electoral issue.\n\nA poster on a street wall in a village on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border read, ""It is the people who vote in elections, not the animals that are encroaching into human settlements. Stop animal rule!""\n\nSuch sentiment arises from a prevalent anthropocentric worldview, where the state forest and wildlife departments are criticised for prioritising animals over human beings.\n\nIn Lok Sabha constituencies in the Western Ghats, the authors observed that environmental concerns hardly influence electoral politics, despite the fact that the daily lives of people in those regions are closely intertwined with nature.\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of this would be the popular protests a decade ago against the Madhav Gadgil-K. Kasturirangan committee reports. These reports aimed at safeguarding the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, a 1,600km-long mountain range from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu, by restricting human construction and certain types of agriculture.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Western Ghats, which is identified as one of the world\'s eight \'hottest hotspots\' of biological diversity, managed to win a Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 election with the support of Left parties and succeeded in stopping the committee\'s pro-environment recommendations from being implemented.\n\nEven though the Western Ghats are one of the worst-hit areas in terms of climate change-triggered casualties, especially from landslides and agricultural loss, the electoral politics of the region largely revolve around conventional issues.\n\nThe attitude in the Western Ghats is in stark contrast to Europe, which votes in early June to elect the next European Parliament. A poll conducted by Euronews and Ipsos in 18 countries found that 52 per cent of voters prioritise the fight against climate change over other issues.\n\nThe so-called \'climate voters\' in Europe are mostly young people. One of the hot topics during elections is the European Green Deal, which aims to make the continent climate-neutral by 2050.\n\nA World Wildlife Fund survey showed that European political parties are particularly focused on combating climate change, as they ""shared support for ending fossil fuel use, transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy, and adopting nature-based solutions to tackle climate change"".\n\nIn Europe, green parties have been actively pushing environmental issues since the 1970s, now holding a major share of the vote in many countries and are putting the climate agenda at the forefront of elections.\n\nWhile not a key issue in the Lok Sabha elections, more extreme temperatures have begun to establish new standards for how Indian voters engage with and assess candidates during campaigning.\n\nAn incident encountered during fieldwork in a Lok Sabha constituency in South India, where there is a tight contest between two high-net-worth candidates from the Congress and BJP, illustrates this. A fruit seller devised his own \'political thermometer\' to compare candidates based on their body language during road shows.\n\nThis campaign tool is less popular in the 2024 general elections due to rising temperatures.\n\n""Just look at his downcast face, wearied under the sunlight. Is this AC-living guy going to speak for us in Parliament? Two days ago, the other candidate passed through this junction in an open jeep. As he did during previous elections, he stood energetically despite the scorching heat, raising his hands to the people with a smile,"" he said.\n\nIn another constituency, people held high regard for an MP who spent hours wearing a local costume and coordinating rescue operations during floods.\n\nAmid the climate crisis, the long-held expectation for any Indian politician to \'be with the people\' now also encompasses standing with them through their lived experiences of climate change.\n\nHowever, Indian democracy is yet to breed a new category of \'climate voters\' as its electoral landscape is still conservative with practically very little space for environmental politics or green agendas.\n\n(This article is syndicated by 360info.org from The Conversation)'"

90,90,"b'VK Pandian, a former IAS officer hailing from Tamil Nadu, has emerged as a central figure within the BJD party. His rapid ascent and perceived alignment with CM Naveen Patnaik have drawn both attention and criticism from opposition leaders, sparking debates about Odia identity and leadership in the state. As Pandian assumes a key role in the party\'s campaign machinery, his influence and potential succession to Naveen\'s legacy are under intense scrutiny.The Odisha election landscape is now dominated by VK Pandian, a former IAS officer from Tamil Nadu who resigned from the service to join the BJD. Pandian, widely regarded as the potential political heir to CM Naveen Patnaik, has assumed a pivotal role as the party\'s chief campaigner and strategist.\n\nHis sudden prominence has made him the primary target of opposition leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP President JP Nadda, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. There are concerns about the possibility of a non-Odia assuming leadership in Odisha, raising questions about Odia identity and self-respect in a state founded on linguistic principles.\n\nWithin the BJD, Pandian is listed among the top 40 star campaigners, positioned prominently alongside party candidates in all campaign activities, often sharing the stage with Naveen himself.\n\nFrom IAS officer to BJD strategist\n\nPandian\'s journey began in 2011 when he joined the CM\'s office as Naveen\'s private secretary, impressing the CM with his efficiency. He quickly rose to become a key figure in devising electoral strategies for the BJD in the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nBefore VK Pandian\'s retirement from his role as the CM\'s secretary in October last year, BJP and Congress leaders had been questioning the extent of his influence and the perceived extra-constitutional authority he wielded. However, his subsequent decision to voluntarily retire and join the BJD shifted the focus to the label of ""outsider"" in discussions surrounding his entry into the party.\n\nPandian remains calm and composed despite the scrutiny.\n\n""I am an Indian by birth and Odia by breath. The mother tongue of my children is Odia and Odisha is my karmabhoomi (land where one works),"" he said.\n\nRegarding the prospect of succeeding Naveen, Pandian expressed that he sees himself inheriting Naveen\'s values of integrity, dedication to the people of Odisha, and hard work. He emphasised that Naveen has always maintained that the people of Odisha will determine his successor.\n\nPandian, who belongs to the 2000-batch of IAS officers, was initially assigned to the Punjab cadre. However, shortly after his marriage to Sujata Rout (now Sujata R Karthikeyan), also an IAS officer of the 2000-batch from Odisha, he requested a transfer to the Odisha cadre. Sujata hails from a village in Kendrapada district, Odisha. Recently, she was transferred to a non-election related and non-public facing position in the state finance department following an Election Commission directive, citing alleged violations of the poll code.\n\nMuch like his mentor Naveen, who often appears in loose-fitting white kurta-pyjama and slippers during public appearances, Pandian maintains a consistent attire of untucked full-sleeve white shirts and predominantly grey trousers at all his meetings.\n\nDuring the alliance negotiations between BJP and BJD in March, Pandian played a pivotal role as the main negotiator for BJD, frequently traveling to Delhi for discussions.\n\nReflecting on Pandian\'s ascent, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, representing BJP in Odisha, expressed concerns over the erosion of established democratic processes under Naveen\'s leadership. He criticized what he perceived as the sidelining of the electoral mandate in favor of an unelected official, highlighting broader concerns about democratic principles and Odisha\'s dignity.\n\nCapitalising on the sentiment of ""Odia asmita,"" BJP aims to secure its first government in Odisha and expand its Lok Sabha seat count beyond the 8 seats obtained in 2019.

100,100,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Before India\'s marathon election kicked off in April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was promising to come back to power with an even bigger majority than he won five years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWith less than two weeks to go before election results are announced, the picture is looking less certain for the popular leader.\n\nParty insiders, opposition members and analysts who have traveled across the country to speak to voters say there\'s little evidence of a ""Modi wave"" that allowed his Bharatiya Janata Party to sweep the polls in 2019. Then, the BJP won 303 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Along with its allies, the BJP-led coalition had about 351 seats.\n\nModi targeted more than 400 seats for his coalition this time around, a goal emblazoned on campaign posters and one the prime minister frequently plugged in his campaign speeches. But a notable shift in Modi\'s tone after the first phase of voting -- where he began using divisive, anti-Muslim language and ramped up attacks against the main opposition group\'s welfare policies -- fueled speculation the BJP may have been spooked by early voting trends and needed to fire up its support base.\n\nElection rules don\'t allow for any result polls to be published during the six weeks of voting, so it\'s difficult to know with any certainty whether the BJP\'s support has indeed declined. India\'s first-past-the-post electoral system means even small margins can decide the winner. Exit polls won\'t be published until June 1 with results expected on June 4.\n\nMuddying the waters even further is the fact that both the ruling party and opposition are claiming publicly they have the upper hand. Modi himself told The Economic Times this week that the BJP has already won a majority of the seats in the parliament based on voting in the first five phases of elections so far.\n\nHowever, behind closed doors a picture is emerging of an opposition alliance that\'s slightly more optimistic about their likely gains, and a ruling party that appears to be bracing for some losses. The Indian National Congress, the main opposition group, expects to win between 90-110 seats in total, up from 52 in 2019, according to a senior party leader, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The estimates were based on internal polling, the person said.\n\nThree BJP officials from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana states privately admitted that the party is unlikely to match its 2019 figures, although they still expect to win a majority of the seats in parliament. The officials asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about internal matters.\n\nNalin Kohli, a spokesman for the BJP, said there\'s no reason why the ruling party and its allies won\'t significantly increase their results from five years ago given the performance of the Modi government and his leadership. Congress party spokespeople weren\'t immediately available to comment when contacted for further information.\n\nUncertainty about the poll outcome has already seeped into financial markets, with volatility rising in recent weeks. The India VIX Index -- a gauge of likely market swings over the next 30 days -- more than doubled from a low in April.\n\nForeigners pulled $3.5 billion from local shares in May, although there are now signs of global funds ending their bearish view. Indian equities hit a record on Thursday after the central bank\'s generous dividend to the government and Modi\'s comments to The Economic Times of an expected ""historic mandate.""\n\nMajority Mark\n\nPolitical analysts and economists are less optimistic.\n\nRahul Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank, expects the BJP to stay in power, while winning anywhere between 282 to 310 seats nationally. Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, was more bearish, saying anecdotal evidence during her recent travels from India\'s east to west coast suggests the BJP could possibly fall below the majority mark of 272 seats. With the help of its allies, though, the party will still be able to form the government, she said in a report on May 16.\n\nReasons for the BJP\'s slide in support are varied, according to party officials and analysts. Modi has been in power for a decade and has delivered on several of the BJP\'s key pledges, a key one being the building of a temple in honor of the Hindu god Ram on a site where an ancient mosque once stood. The inauguration of the temple in Ayodhya in January fulfilled a key promise made to the BJP\'s Hindu nationalist base for decades.\n\n""Anecdotal evidence from our travels on the election trail from India\'s east coast to its west suggests that Modi\'s popularity has waned somewhat since the Ram temple inauguration in January, when a BJP wave seemed to have swept across India,"" Deveshwar said. ""Although multiple factors at play in a country as vast as India make the national mood difficult to read, common themes we picked up on the road include the lack of job creation and rising demand for welfare schemes.""\n\nBeyond those, voters\' concerns have been dominated by the high cost of living and caste identity, observers say. The opposition\'s heavy focus on improving the welfare of the poor, especially those who belong to the lowest social groups, have resonated with voters, they say.\n\nModi\'s 400-seat target may have been counter-productive, too, since it might have led to complacency in the BJP\'s ranks while fueling a belief among lower-caste voters that the BJP will use its parliamentary super-majority to push through changes that reduce affirmative action policies for lower socio-economic groups. Home Minister Amit Shah has consistently denied the party has any such plan, although that hasn\'t stopped the opposition from exploiting voters\' anxiety around this.\n\nThe shift in momentum was in some evidence in the electorally important state of Uttar Pradesh, considered a stronghold for the BJP after it swept the region with 71 out of 80 seats in 2014 and won 62 in the 2019 elections.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, the biggest opposition group in Uttar Pradesh, has been drawing significant crowds to political rallies, where he campaigns alongside alliance members, like the Congress party and the Trinamool Congress. The alliance parties have agreed not to contest seats against each other, allowing them to consolidate the opposition vote against the BJP.\n\nWATCH: How India\'s Leader Is Preparing for a 1,000-Year Legacy\n\nYadav and Rahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party, were due to address a rally together earlier this week in a town in Uttar Pradesh, but were forced to leave after throngs of supporters rushed the stage to see the two leaders, pushing through police barricades.\n\nThe two men, relatively young leaders in their 50s, represent change for the voters who are disillusioned with the decade-long rule of 73-year-old Modi.

Flying in on a helicopter that sent dust clouds high up in the air, Yadav was cheered on by more than 8,000 supporters, predominantly young men, waiting in 40-degree heat to catch a glimpse of the leader, campaigning there on behalf of a candidate from the Trinamool Congress.\n\nYadav told his supporters the alliance will increase government jobs and waive loans for farmers, prompting huge roars from the crowd. In an interview after his speech, he criticized the Modi government for its policies and said the ruling party was losing support because of rising joblessness and inflation. He said the opposition alliance was aligned on its priorities, including improving affirmative action policies for the lowest caste groups.\n\nHe predicted the BJP will lose its majority and the opposition will form the government.\n\n""The BJP route to power was through Uttar Pradesh, now they are losing all seats and that will be their end,"" Yadav said.\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty and Ravil Shirodkar.'"
101,101,"b'SAMASTIPUR, India (AP) -- Narendra Modi swept to power a decade ago on promises to transform India\'s economy, and it would be hard to argue he hasn\'t made strides. As he seeks a third term as prime minister, the country\'s economic growth is the envy of the world, its stock markets are booming, and new buildings and highways are popping up everywhere.\n\nThere are cracks in the facade, though, that his political challengers hope to benefit from, including high unemployment, persistent poverty and the sense that only a small portion of India\'s 1.4 billion people has been able to cash in on the good fortune.\n\n""You have a booming economy for people higher up on the socioeconomic ladder, but people lower down are really struggling,"" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nModi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have remained popular since he was first elected prime minister in 2014 on a strident Hindu-first platform and pledges to succeed where past governments had failed by finally transforming the economy from rural to industrial.\n\nHe promised to clamp down on deeply rooted corruption and to leverage the country\'s manpower advantage to turn it into a manufacturing powerhouse. While campaigning this spring -- the six-week-long election concludes Saturday -- Modi has vowed to make India\'s economy the world\'s third-largest, trailing only those of the U.S. and China. Votes will be counted Tuesday.\n\nModi has had successes. The economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during his tenure -- a big step toward formalizing an economy where many jobs are still off the books and untaxed. His administration has also poured billions of dollars into the country\'s creaky infrastructure to lure investment, and notably streamlined its vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population and which his party is leveraging to try to win over poor and disillusioned voters.\n\nDespite these advances, though, Modi\'s economic policies have failed to generate employment that moves people from low-paying, precarious work to secure, salaried jobs. With inequality, joblessness and underemployment soaring, they\'ve become central themes of the election.\n\nEven as India\'s millionaires multiply, nearly 90% of its working-age population earns less than the country\'s average annual income of around $2,770, according to a World Inequality Lab study. The top 1% own more than 40% of the country\'s wealth, while the bottom 50% own just above 6%, the study found.\n\nTo stem economic discontent, Modi and the BJP are hoping to win over poor and disgruntled voters with more than $400 billion in welfare subsidies and cash transfers.\n\nAt the heart of their welfare agenda is a free ration program, which serves 800 million people. It existed under the previous government and is a right under India\'s National Food Security Act. But it was greatly expanded during the pandemic to provide grain for free, instead of just cheap, and then extended for another five years beginning in January.\n\nThrough roughly 300 programs, hundreds of millions have received household goods ranging from cooking gas cylinders to free toilets. Millions of homes have been built for the poor, who now have greater access to piped water, Wi-Fi and electricity. And the government has ramped up cash transfers to farmers and other key voting blocs.\n\nWhen Rajesh Prajapati lost his job at a chemical factory in Prayagraj, a city in India\'s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, his family of five survived on government grain.\n\n""For almost a year, the free ration was our only solace,"" he said, adding that it was the reason they voted for Modi again.\n\nIndian parties have always used welfare to win elections. But experts say the BJP has done it better.\n\nBenefits such as subsidies, pensions and loans are now delivered through cash transfers directly to bank accounts linked to each individual\'s biometric identity card, which the government says has helped eliminate leakages and corruption by cutting out intermediaries.\n\nThese large-scale handouts provide relief, but some say they are only a temporary fix and a sign of rising economic distress. To reduce inequality, they should be accompanied by investment in health and education, which have stagnated in recent years, said Ashoka Mody, an economist at Princeton University.\n\nSubsidies are helpful, ""but they do not create the ability of people to put themselves on a trajectory where they and their children can look forward to a better future,"" he said.\n\nTuntun Sada, a farmworker from Samastipur, a city in the eastern state of Bihar, said the 18 kilograms (40 pounds) of free grain that helps feed his family of six each month has only marginally improved their lives. He still earns less than $100 a month after working the fields of wealthier landowners.\n\n""People like us don\'t get very much,"" Sada said. ""Modi should walk the talk. If we don\'t earn enough, how will we raise our children?""\n\nThe free rations don\'t last through the month, piped water has yet to reach his community and there are no nearby schools for his four kids to attend. What he really needs, he said, is a better job.\n\nModi\'s opposition, led by the Congress party, are betting on the jobs crisis to dent the BJP\'s chances of securing a majority. Before the election, a survey by the Center for Study of Developing Societies found that more than 60% of voters were worried about unemployment and believed finding a job had become tougher. Only 12% felt like economic opportunities had increased.\n\nOfficial government data, which many economists question, shows the unemployment rate declining. But a recent report from the International Labor Organization found that youth unemployment in India is higher than the global average, that more than 40% of Indians still work in agriculture, and that 90% of workers are in informal employment.\n\nThe liberalizing of India\'s economy in the 1990s laid the foundation for the remarkable growth since, with millions escaping poverty and spawning a middle class. But it has also allowed for the growing disparity between rich and poor, economists say.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the main face of the opposition, has sought to tap into the growing resentment felt by the country\'s many have-nots by promising to take on the issue of wealth distribution if his alliance gains power.\n\nModi, who says his government has lifted 250 million Indians out of poverty, is unapologetic. In a TV interview this month, he said wealth distribution is a gradual process and dismissed criticism of the growing inequality by asking, ""Should everyone be poor?""\n\nBoth the BJP and the Congress party say they will create more employment through various sectors including construction, manufacturing and government jobs. Experts say this is crucial for reducing economic disparities, but it\'s also hard to do.\n\nMass unemployment and underemployment have always been intractable problems in India, so parties inevitably fall back on the promises of handouts, said Mody, the Princeton economist. Case in point: The Congress party has pledged to double people\'s free rations if voted into power.\n\n""It\'s completely the wrong focus... what we need is job creation,"" Mody said. ""And there is no one today who has an idea of how to solve that problem.""\n\nKrutika Pathi And Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press'"

Krishnamurthy told Reuters.\n\nModi also urged people to ""vote in large numbers"" in a message on social media platform X on Saturday.\n\nIt was not clear which party would gain from a lower turnout.\n\nThe temperature in the capital hovered around 42C (107.6F) but felt like 49C (120.2F) at 2 p.m., the weather department said, prompting many voters to question why polls were not held when the weather was ""more conducive"".\n\nAt 3 p.m., turnout in the city stood at 44.5%.\n\nAt a school in the Trilokpuri area that was being used for polling, sheets and tarpaulin were strung up in the courtyard to provide shade to voters queuing up despite the heat.\n\n""If we sit at home saying it is hot outside, who will vote?"" said housewife Bhuwneshwari Pillai, 32, fanning herself with a sheet of paper and mopping her brow with a towel.\n\nIn some parts of the northern state of Haryana, people living near polling booths also pitched in to help voters beat the heat, handing out free cold drinks and dried fruits.\n\nVOTERS\' CONCERNS\n\nPrice rises and a lack of jobs were two of the major issues mentioned by voters to Reuters on Saturday when asked about the factors that determined their vote.\n\n""Our youth are unemployed, the prices of essential commodities have sky-rocketed.

113,113,"b'India\'s financial capital Mumbai began voting Monday when six-week national elections resumed, with much of the megacity\'s business and entertainment elite vocal in their support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe 73-year-old leader is widely expected to win a third term when the poll concludes early next month, thanks in large part to his aggressive championing of India\'s majority Hindu faith.\n\nBig conglomerates have bestowed upon Modi\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a campaign war chest that dwarfs its rivals, while Bollywood stars have backed its ideological commitment to more closely align the country\'s majority religion and its politics.\n\nData published this year showed that the BJP was by far the single biggest beneficiary of electoral bonds, a contentious political donation tool since ruled illegal by India\'s top court.\n\nLeading companies and wealthy businesspeople gave the party $730 million, accounting for just under half of all donations made under the scheme in the past five years.\n\nConglomerate owners support Modi\'s government because it caters to the needs of India\'s ""existing oligarchic business elite"", Deepanshu Mohan of OP Jindal Global University told AFP.\n\nLower corporate tax rates, less red tape and a reduction in ""municipal regulatory corruption"" have also helped Modi win the affection of corporate titans, he added.\n\nBut it is Modi\'s cultivated image as a champion of the Hindu faith, rather than an economy still characterised by widespread unemployment and income inequality, that has undergirded his enduring popularity with the wider public.\n\nThis year in the town of Ayodhya, he presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.\n\nConstruction of the temple fulfilled a longstanding demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across the country with back-to-back television coverage and street parties.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by hundreds of eminent Indians including Asia\'s richest man Mukesh Ambani, whose family donated $300,000 to the temple\'s trust.\n\nAlso present were cricket icon and Mumbai native Sachin Tendulkar along with actor Amitabh Bachchan -- the single most famous product of Bollywood, as the financial hub\'s film industry is known.\n\nNumerous screen stars have established themselves as vocal champions of Modi\'s administration since he was swept to office a decade ago.\n\nFormer soap actress Smriti Irani is one of the government\'s most recognised ministers and beat India\'s seniormost opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in the contest for her current parliamentary seat in 2019.\n\nFilmmakers have also produced several provocative and ideologically charged films to match the ruling party\'s sectarian messaging, which critics say deliberately maligns India\'s 200-million-plus Muslim minority.\n\nLast year\'s ""Kerala Story"" was heavily promoted by the BJP but condemned elsewhere for falsely claiming thousands of Hindu women had been brainwashed by Muslims to join the Islamic State group.\n\n- Heatwave returns -\n\nIndia\'s election is conducted in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging the democratic exercise in the world\'s most populous country.\n\nThe latest round is taking place as parts of India endure their second heatwave in three weeks, after much of the continent suffered searing temperatures in April.\n\nTurnout is down several percentage points from the last national poll in 2019, with analysts blaming widespread expectations of a Modi victory as well as hotter-than-average temperatures heading into the Indian summer.\n\nTens of millions of people in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Jharkhand states are voting under heatwave conditions and temperatures expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.\n\nScientific research shows climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense, with Asia warming faster than the global average.\n\nMore than 968 million people are eligible to vote in the Indian election, with the final round of polling on June 1 and results expected three days later.'"
114,114,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party targeting opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week long election.\n\nThe videos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India\'s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups.\n\nThe Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video has been shared ""clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions"".\n\nA set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibit them from creating ""mutual hatred"" between caste, religious or linguistic groups.\n\nManipulated videos on social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticizing the prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage.

India allows candidates to contest multiple constituencies but represent only one.\n\nSonia Gandhi, Congress party chief and former lawmaker from Raebareli, made an emotional appeal to voters asking them to vote for her son in a region that the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has dominated in the last 10 years.\n\nSmriti Irani, minister for women and child development, is contesting from Amethi.

Votes will be counted on June 4 although television channels conduct exit polls and project results after voting ends.\n\nModi, who is seeking a record-equalling third straight term and is widely expected to win, began his re-election campaign by focusing on his achievements over the last 10 years but soon switched to mostly targeting the opposition by accusing them of favouring India\'s minority Muslims.\n\nThis change of tack, analysts said, was likely aimed at firing up his Hindu nationalist base after a low turnout in the first phase sparked concerns that supporters of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were not voting.\n\nIndia\'s election rules stop campaigning about 36 hours before voting begins.\n\nModi addressed one rally in the northern state of Punjab on Thursday, while his main opponent, the Congress party\'s Rahul Gandhi, spoke at rallies in the states of Odisha and Punjab.\n\n""It is clear from the overwhelming support of people ... that there is going to be an unprecedented victory"" for BJP and the alliance it leads, Modi posted on X minutes before campaigning ended.\n\nModi will spend the next two days meditating at the southernmost tip of India at an island memorial for Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda, located at where the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean converge.\n\nOpposition parties criticised his decision, saying it was a form of campaigning as his meditation would be shown on TV and so was in breach of the rules, with the Congress complaining to the Election Commission.\n\n""This is a blatant violation of the code of conduct.

118,118,"b'MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\'s incoming government will be greeted with a $25 billion cheque from the central bank, giving it the option to either boost spending or narrow the fiscal deficit quicker, both of which will be cheered by investors.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a record 2.11 trillion rupees dividend transfer to the government, more than double New Delhi\'s and street estimates, leading to a decline in bond yields and a rise in equity markets.\n\nThe surplus fund can help the new government, which will take charge after the current elections, bring down its fiscal deficit by 0.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) or increase spending on infrastructure or ""populist"" stimulus, Citi Research\'s Samiran Chakraborty said.\n\n""The bond markets would likely hope that the government follows the deficit reduction route, while the equity markets would likely prefer the government taking the expenditure increase one,"" said Chakraborty.\n\nDuring the election campaigns, the opposition Congress promised annual cash handouts of 100,000 rupees ($1,202.07) to poor women and unemployed youth. The party\'s star campaigner Rahul Gandhi also promised debt waiver for farmers.\n\nBut Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has avoided promising any new major welfare measures.\n\n""Despite higher revenue from the RBI dividend, we doubt the government would opt for more populist expenditure in its budget, if the government is BJP-led,"" said Shreya Sodhani, an economist at Barclays.\n\n""The current government has not shown a disposition towards populist spending even in an election year.""\n\nThe BJP-led government resisted the temptation of spending trillions of rupees on schemes for the poor in its last budget before the election while raising spending on infrastructure to 11.11 trillion rupees, more than three time the sum spent in 2019.\n\nQUICKER FISCAL CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe new government will likely present the final budget in July, leaving the administration with only eight months to spend funds allocated to them.\n\nGovernment spending has been slow so far in the year, with the start of elections from April. Tax collections, meanwhile, have been strong due to buoyancy in the economy.\n\nIndia collected a record 2.10 trillion rupees in goods and services taxes in April, the first month of the financial year, ensuring the government is on track to meet its planned fiscal goal of 5.1% of GDP this year.\n\nThis could mean the government will lean towards using the bumper dividend for fiscal consolidation.\n\nThere is scope for a slight reduction in the targeted fiscal deficit for the current year, said Ashima Goyal, a professor and an external member of the country\'s monetary policy committee, who expects the government to comfortably achieve the targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5% by 2025/26.\n\nIndia\'s fiscal deficit ballooned to 9.2% during the pandemic but the government has steadily brought this down.\n\nBut bringing down the deficit by 130 basis points from 5.8% in 2023/24 was seen as challenging and dependent on one-off revenue from either privatisation or auction of telecom spectrum.\n\n($1 = 83.1900 Indian rupees)\n\n(Reporting by Aftab Ahmed and Swati Bhat; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)'"

127,127,"b""NEW DELHI (AP) -- Parts of northwest India sweltered under scorching temperatures on Saturday, with the capital New Delhi under a severe weather alert as extreme temperatures strike parts of the country.\n\nIndia's weather department expects heat wave conditions to persist across the north for the next few days, and has put several states on high alert.\n\nOn Friday, parts of New Delhi reported up to 47.1 degrees Celsius (116 degrees Fahrenheit). The nearby states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan also saw temperatures soar and are likely to stay high over the next few days, said Soma Sen Roy, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department.\n\nRoy cautioned people against going outdoors under the afternoon sun, drink lots of water and wear loose-fitting clothes while who are especially vulnerable like the elderly should stay indoors.\n\nThe extreme temperatures in northern India coincide with a 6-week-long general election, with experts worried that the heat wave could increase health risks as people wait in long lines to cast their vote or candidates campaign aggressively in the outdoors. One minister fainted due to heat last month while addressing an election rally in Maharashtra state.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi as well as his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the opposition Congress Party, are expected to hold rallies in New Delhi later on Saturday, as the city heads to the polls on May 25.\n\nThe main summer months -- April, May and June -- are always hot in most parts of India before monsoon rains bring cooler temperatures. But the heat has become more intense in the past decade and is usually accompanied by severe water shortages, with tens of millions of India's 1.4 billion people lacking running water.\n\nA study by World Weather Attribution, an academic group that examines the source of extreme heat, found that a searing heat wave in April that struck parts of Asia was made at least 45 times more likely in some parts of the continent by climate change.\n\nClimate experts say extreme heat in South Asia during the pre-monsoon season is becoming more frequent and the study found that extreme temperatures are now about 0.85 C (1.5 F) hotter in the region because of climate change.\n\nAt least 28 heat-related deaths were reported in Bangladesh, as well as five in India in April. Surges in heat deaths have also been reported in Thailand and the Philippines this year, according to the study.\n\nExtreme heat is fast becoming a public health crisis in India, with more than 150 people dying last year during heat waves. The government estimates nearly 11,000 people have died during heat waves this century, yet experts say such figures are likely a vast undercount."""
128,128,"b'NEW DELHI (AP) -- Millions of Indians are voting Saturday in the next-to-last round of a grueling national election with a combined opposition trying to rattle Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s campaign for a third-consecutive term for himself and his Hindu nationalist party.\n\nMany people lined polling stations before the start of voting at 7 a.m. to avoid the blazing sun later in the day at the peak of Indian summer.\n\nSaturday\'s voting in 58 constituencies, including seven in New Delhi, will complete polling for 89.5% of 543 seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nThe voting for the remaining 57 seats on June 1 will wrap up a six-week election. The votes will be counted on June 4.\n\nThis election is considered one of the most consequential in India\'s history and will test Modi\'s political dominance. If Modi wins, he\'ll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term, after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country\'s first prime minister.\n\nA less-than-expected voter turnout in the previous five rounds of voting seems to have left both sides guessing about the outcome of the election.\n\nTemperatures are likely to rise above 45 Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some places on Saturday. Election authorities said they are taking steps to ensure voters\' comfort, such as setting up fans and tents and providing drinking water.\n\nMost polls predict a win for Modi\'s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.\n\nModi was involved in a highly acrimonious and mudslinging campaign with the opposition, led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has produced three prime ministers.\n\n""When the polls began it felt like a one-horse race, with Modi leading from the front. But now we are seeing some kind of shift,"" political analyst Rasheed Kidwai said. ""The opposition is doing better than expected and it appears that Modi\'s party is rattled. That\'s the reason you see Modi ramping up anti-Muslim rhetoric to polarize voters.""\n\nKidwai said the opposition has challenged Modi by centering its campaign narrative on social justice and rising unemployment, making the contest closer than expected.\n\nModi ran his campaign like a presidential race, a referendum on his 10 years of rule. He claimed to help the poorest with charity, free health care, providing toilets in their homes, and helping women get free or cheap cooking gas cylinders.\n\nBut he changed tack after a poor turnout of voters in the first round of the election and began stirring Hindu nationalism by accusing the Congress party of pandering to minority Muslims for votes.\n\nHindus account for 80%, and Muslims nearly 14%, of India\'s over 1.4 billion people.\n\nNearly 970 million voters -- more than 10% of the world\'s population -- were eligible to elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.\n\nVoters\' relative apathy has surprised some political analysts. In the five rounds of polling the voter turnout ranged between 62.2% to 69.16% -- averaging 65.9%. By comparison, India\'s 2019 national election registered the highest-ever voter turnout -- 67.11%. Modi\'s BJP won 303 seats in parliament in 2019.\n\nModi\'s inauguration of a massive Hindu temple for the most revered Lord Rama, his massive roadshows, and big public rallies raised the BJP\'s hopes of a massive a surge of voters in its favor.\n\nModi came to power in 2014, dislodging the Congress party that governed the country for nearly 55 years after India won independence from British colonialists in 1947.\n\nBefore the election, the opposition INDIA alliance was seen bickering, but it has since held together, particularly after two chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states were sent to jail on corruption charges. Both deny the accusations.\n\nOne of them -- New Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal -- has since been released on bail and returned to the campaign trail.\n\nIn March, Gandhi completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,171-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, and democracy with voters.\n\n""The walk helped Gandhi boost his image as a serious politician among the voters, and that is helping the opposition,"" Kidwai said.\n\nAssociated Press Writer Sheikh Saaliq contributed from New Delhi.'"
129,129,"b'AYODHYA, India (AP) -- Millions of Indians across 49 constituencies began casting ballots on Monday as the country\'s six-week-long election enters its final stages with voting also being held in northern Ayodhya city, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened a controversial Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nMonday\'s polling in the fifth round of multi-phase national elections across six states and two union territories is crucial for Modi\'s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The polls in Uttar Pradesh\'s Ayodhya are seen as a litmus test for Modi\'s Hindu-first politics, as he has hailed the opening of the Hindu temple as his government\'s crowning achievement.\n\nThe staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million eligible voters, more than 10% of the world\'s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years. The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4.\n\nModi last year opened the controversial Hindu temple built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu mobs in 1992. The temple was built at an estimated cost of $217 million and its opening was seen as a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state. It also fulfilled a longstanding demand of the majority Hindus.\n\nModi and his party, who have mixed religion and politics, hope that Hindu sentiment and fervor over the opening of the temple will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term. But experts say the issue may not be enough to rally the region\'s Hindu majority toward the BJP, particularly at a time when many Indians say they are affected by rising unemployment and inflation.\n\n""Issues like unemployment, inflation, lack of security and the government\'s attempts to muzzle dissent are glaring problems that the BJP has no answers to,"" said Amarnath Agarwal, a political analyst.\n\nAgarwal said excitement over the Hindu temple may not have translated into a significant political issue for the ruling party and it is ""evident from the lack of interest among voters, reflected in a notably low turnout.""\n\nWith two more phases of polling left, overall voter turnout has been lower than in previous elections. Some poll experts have suggested that some of Modi\'s party core supporters were staying away.\n\nMost polls show Modi and his party leading in the race for seats in the lower house of Parliament over their main challenger, a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties. However, it faces stiff resistance from the opposition, which appears to have tapped into discontent against Modi\'s government.\n\nShachindra Sharma, who votes Monday, said while the temple was a matter of faith for many Hindus like him, he would vote for a party that upholds constitutional values.\n\n""Why should the Ram Temple be a guiding factor for voters? Lord Ram is a matter of faith, while voting is a democratic process to elect a government. Is there any guarantee that a party advocating for the Ram Temple will provide security and lead the country towards progress?"" Sharma said.\n\nHis wife, Renuka Sharma, disagreed, arguing that the temple remains a crucial deciding factor in polls.\n\n""I will vote for the party that built the Ram Temple because Lord Ram is the biggest issue in this election,"" she said.\n\nModi\'s party has repeatedly reiterated the temple\'s centrality to the election narrative. He has also increasingly used anti-Muslim rhetoric in his campaign speeches.\n\nUttar Pradesh\'s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in an election rally last week, said the choice between ""devotees of Ram"" and""anti-Ram forces"" is the defining theme of the national election, referring to the opposition parties.\n\n""You should vote for devotees of Ram because they are the people who built Ram Temple for you,"" he said.\n\nModi has also capitalized on the emotive appeal of the temple among Hindus and sometimes falsely accused opposition parties of attempting to overturn the court\'s verdict that allowed its construction. On Friday, he claimed that if the opposition comes to power it will raze the temple.\n\nMonday\'s polling will also see opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, running for office from Rae Bareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh state.\n\nGandhi also ran for office from Wayanad in southern India, which has already voted. India allows candidates to contest multiple constituencies but they can represent only one.'"
130,130,"b'New Delhi CNN --\n\nTwo of the planet\'s richest businessmen are becoming embroiled in India\'s increasingly divisive election campaign.\n\nThe world\'s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.\n\nModi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India, as well as for its two most famous billionaires: Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Likened to the industrialists who helped build America\'s ""Gilded Age,"" both men are considered vocal champions of Modi and their perceived closeness has been the subject of intense criticism by rival politicians.\n\nBut at an election rally on Wednesday, Modi appeared to accuse his primary political opponent of accepting money from Ambani, chairman of India\'s most valuable private company Reliance Industries, and Gautam Adani, the founder of ports-to-energy conglomerate the Adani Group.\n\n""Why has Shahzade Ji stopped talking of Ambani and Adani in this election all of sudden? People are smelling a secret deal,"" Modi said on X, where he posted a video of his speech. Shahzade, or prince, is a widely understood reference to Rahul Gandhi, the longtime face of main opposition party Indian National Congress.\n\n""How much money have you taken from Ambani and Adani?"" he said at the rally.\n\nGandhi, the scion of a dynasty that has given India three prime ministers, has often asked tough questions about the relationship between Modi and the country\'s leading tycoons.\n\n""Are you scared, Modi"" Gandhi said in a response on X on Wednesday. ""This is the first time you have talked about Ambani and Adani in public.""\n\n""I want to repeat to the country that the amount of money Modi has given to these businessmen, we are going to give the same amount to India\'s poor,"" he added, asking for an official investigation into the two conglomerates.\n\nReliance and the Adani Group did not respond to a CNN request for comment.\n\nOpaque nature of funding\n\nWhile each candidate has accused the other of receiving truckloads of money illegally from both businessmen, neither has provided any proof to back their claims.\n\nEarlier this year, India\'s Supreme Court made a major ruling concerning the often opaque nature of political funding. It declared that a system of anonymous donations introduced by the Modi government in 2017 was ""unconstitutional.""\n\nThe electoral bonds system had allowed individuals or groups to buy bonds from the government-run State Bank of India and donate them anonymously to any political party.\n\nAnti-corruption groups have long complained that the system meant a lack of transparency regarding donations to political parties -- allowing corporations to donate large sums without disclosure.\n\nWhile Modi\'s speech about the billionaires made headlines in India, analysts do not expect his comments to trigger detailed scrutiny by local media or an official investigation.\n\n""Given the close ties between legacy media and top businesses in India, there is no major desire to go after crony capitalism in the country,"" said Abhinandan Sekhri, co-founder of Newslaundry, an independent news website that focuses on media.\n\nMany of India\'s leading media companies are owned by large conglomerates that invest in a vast array of industries, and they\'re under pressure to stay friendly to the ruling party to ensure favorable policies for their other businesses, analysts have said.\n\nAdani took over NDTV, an influential broadcaster, in 2022, while Ambani owns Network 18, which includes the CNN-News18 TV channel, a CNN affiliate.\n\nBillionaire Raj\n\nIn the last decade, both Ambani and Adani have stunned the world with their success and influence.\n\nAmbani, 67, is Asia\'s richest man and controls an empire that has businesses ranging from oil and clean energy to telecom and media.\n\nAmbani\'s empire has businesses ranging from oil and clean energy to telecom and retail. Noemi Cassanelli/CNN\n\nMuch like Reliance, Adani\'s colossal $200 billion conglomerate operates in key industries, including energy and logistics, which are considered indispensable to India\'s economic growth. According to Bloomberg, the billionaire is currently the second richest person in Asia, but he briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\'s second-wealthiest person in 2022.\n\nWhile investors have been cheering the duo\'s ability to bet on sectors prioritized by Modi, critics have said their rise is fuelling crony capitalism in the world\'s fastest growing economy.\n\nModi used Adani\'s private aircraft while he was campaigning to become prime minister in 2014. Over the years, both the ruling party and the industrialist have denied any suggestion of favoritism.\n\nIn January 2023, the Adani group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of engaging in fraud over decades.\n\nAdani denounced Hindenburg\'s report as ""baseless"" and ""malicious."" But that failed to halt a stunning stock market meltdown that, at one point, wiped more than $100 billion off the value of its listed companies.\n\nPolitical leaders from India\'s main opposition party ferociously questioned Adani\'s relationship with the prime minister, and some even said that they were punished for pursuing the issue.\n\nSince then, Adani has made a remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs.'"

Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party\'s official local X account ""promoted enmity"" between religious groups after the clip was posted online on May 4.\n\nThe 17-second animation depicts leaders of India\'s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: ""Beware... Beware... Beware...!""\n\nIt shows caricatures of Congress\'s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding ""funds"" to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh.\n\nThe video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India\'s Election Commission to take it down.\n\nCNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment.\n\nCritics said Congress\' manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a ""blatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,"" and urged the Election Commission to address its ""divisive tactics.""\n\nMany of India\'s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi\'s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP\'s campaign.\n\nLast month, the BJP\'s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims.\n\n""If you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,"" said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram.\n\nThat video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims - who have been present in India for centuries - of being ""infiltrators"" who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population.\n\nModi\'s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants.\n\nThe election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations.\n\nIn an interview with local broadcaster Times Now on Monday, Modi said the BJP is ""not opposed to Islam and Muslims.""\n\nBut many Muslims were skeptical.\n\n""This is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,"" prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub said in response to the speech.'"

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN --\n\nInvestors are grappling with a painful reality check: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates anytime soon.\n\nThat, at least temporarily, stalled the gangbusters 2024 stock rally and lowered morale on Wall Street. Traders fear that elevated rates will uphold painfully high borrowing costs for consumers, squeeze corporate profit and weigh down the market.\n\nThe good news? History suggests that higher-for-longer rates don\'t translate to painful losses for portfolios, even if there may not be much more upside near term for stocks.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index has added roughly 13% on average during Fed pause periods, according to LPL Financial data compiled by CNN spanning about 35 years and six stretches when rates have been on hold. The S&P 500 has gained 14% during the current period, from when the Fed last hiked rates in July 2023 through Thursday\'s close.\n\n""Long pauses are typically good for stocks,"" wrote Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in a Tuesday note. ""It\'s when the Fed is forced to cut because of economic weakness that stocks tend to sell off -- not in the environment we\'re in today.""\n\nThe US economy has stayed remarkably resilient, even after the Fed began an aggressive battle against wayward inflation that brought rates to their highest level in decades. The labor market has stayed strong, consumers have continued spending and stocks have notched repeated record highs.\n\nThat economic resilience, coupled with months of data showing sticky inflation, even raised concerns that the Fed would raise rates again. Chair Jerome Powell earlier this month quelled those fears but warned that the central bank needs to see inflation come down further before easing policy.\n\n""So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular, as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations,"" Powell said at the Federal Open Market Committee\'s post-meeting press conference.\n\nSome economists say that the central bank, which has penciled in three rate cuts for 2024, is still on track to cut rates at least once or twice this year. Traders expect the Fed will begin easing rates in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe April jobs report was a welcome sign that the labor market is cooling without cratering. The labor market added just 175,000 positions last month, marking its lowest tally since October 2023 and a sharp cooldown from the upwardly revised 315,000 jobs added in March. April\'s job gains are in line with pre-pandemic levels and the neutral rate of job growth needed to pace with population growth.\n\nFirst-time applications for unemployment benefits climbed last week to 231,000, the highest level since last August, in another sign that the labor market is cooling.\n\nAnnual wage gains, a potential inflation booster watched closely by the Fed, are at their lowest level since May 2021. The slowdown in both wage gain and payroll growth last month is supportive of hopes that the Fed can tamp down inflation without triggering a recession, according to some investors.\n\n""The case for rate cuts got a little stronger,"" wrote David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, in a note earlier this month. ""Goldilocks could be making a comeback.""\n\nTreasury launches \'Project Fortress,\' an alliance with banks against hackers\n\nThe US federal government is teaming up with Wall Street in a new cybersecurity alliance aimed at defending the financial system from a nightmare attack and deterring hackers from even trying, according to a letter sent to bank CEOs by a senior Treasury official and viewed by CNN.\n\nThe new public-private partnership, dubbed Project Fortress, underscores the real danger US officials and bank executives believe cyberattacks pose to the economy, reports my colleague Matt Egan.\n\n""The message to bad actors who want to use cyberspace to go after US financial institutions is: We are watching, we are protecting the system and we will come after you if you go after the US financial system,"" a US official told CNN.\n\nProject Fortress includes protective measures such as a new cyber hygiene tool that automatically scans companies for vulnerabilities and a new automated threat feed, according to the letter, which was sent to bank trade groups earlier this week.\n\nBut Project Fortress is not just about playing defense.\n\nDeputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the letter that the alliance also includes ""offensive actions"" that employ Treasury\'s national security tools as well as US law enforcement to ""make clear to our adversaries that they will face consequences for their attacks.""\n\nThose national security tools include deploying Treasury\'s sanctions team, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAsia\'s most powerful billionaires are getting drawn into the world\'s biggest election\n\nTwo of the planet\'s richest businessmen are becoming embroiled in India\'s increasingly divisive election campaign, reports my colleague Diksha Madhok.\n\nThe world\'s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term.\n\nModi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India, as well as for its two most famous billionaires: Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.\n\nLikened to the industrialists who helped build America\'s ""Gilded Age,"" both men are considered vocal champions of Modi and their perceived closeness has been the subject of intense criticism by rival politicians.\n\nBut at an election rally on Wednesday, Modi appeared to accuse his primary political opponent of accepting money from Ambani, chairman of India\'s most valuable private company Reliance Industries, and Gautam Adani, the founder of ports-to-energy conglomerate the Adani Group.\n\n""Why has Shahzade Ji stopped talking of Ambani and Adani in this election all of sudden?

Adani Group\'s market capitalisation on Wednesday regained the $200 billion-mark (Rs 16.9 lakh crore) after its listed firms gained Rs 11,300 crore as investors reposed faith in the company denying any wrongdoing in the supply of coal to Tamil Nadu power company. With Rs 11,300 crore gain on Wednesday, the apples-to-airport conglomerate gained Rs 56,250 crore in market capitalisation in the last two trading sessions, stock exchange data showed.\n\nThe gain came on a day when London-based Financial Times, citing documents from George Soros-backed Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) in a report alluded to a fraud by Adani group by selling low grade coal as high value fuel in 2013.\n\nWhile Adani group denied all allegations, the news report was cited by opposition leaders including former Congress president Rahul Gandhi to demand a probe by a joint parliamentary committee into the alleged wrongdoing.\n\nA spokesperson for the group said the quality of the coal was independently tested at the point of loading and discharge, as well as by customs authorities and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Company (Tangedco) officials. ""With the supplied coal having passed such an elaborate quality check process by multiple agencies at multiple points, clearly the allegation of supply of low-quality coal is not only baseless and unfair but completely absurd.""\n\n""Moreover, the payment is dependent on the quality of coal supplied, which is determined through the testing process,"" the spokesperson said, adding tests for quality of consignment in question had yielded results within permissible limits.\n\nIt went on to state that the vessel cited in the report to have carried the coal in December 2013 had in fact not been used for shipping coal from Indonesia before February 2014.\n\n""The allegations are based only on the difference in the FOB and CIF price of coal, extrapolating it to the supply of low gross calorific value (GCV) coal, and are baseless conjectures and surmises. Not only are the two prices not comparable, but the procurement price itself is not relevant because the order of supply was a fixed price contract, with both the upside and downside to be borne by the supplier,"" it said.\n\nThe group termed as rehash of old allegations references in the report to DRI enquiry.\n\nThe inquiry into allegations of over valuation of Indonesia coal imports, it said, was initiated against 40 companies. ""The Adani companies furnished details sought by the DRI more than four years ago. Thereafter, the DRI has not asked for further documents. Nor has the DRI communicated any deficiency or objection.""\n\nOn allegations of middlemen being involved in the deal, the group said, ""Adani Global Pte Ltd sources coal from people/firms/traders having requisite credentials and experience.

So, to suddenly make us out to be some sort of communist Marxist government which we have never been, is simply not fair.""\n\nHas the Congress Party failed to communicate properly what they mean by a socio-economic survey in their manifesto and what it aims to do? It was a great krantikari (revolutionary) bite, great for television, but just look what it ended up doing? The Prime Minister has hit a full toss on it.\n\nShashi Tharoor: No, let me explain to you exactly what was intended and what Rahul Gandhi said as well, which is that as long as our government, state and central, are giving and not giving certain benefits to people on the basis of their caste affiliation, we may as well know what caste people are claiming allegiance to, number one.\n\nNumber two, it is not just enough to know the numbers, we should know what their economic status is like. For example, if you actually have a socio-economic census, you will know what caste people belong to and what they are earning and what their assets are. If it turns out for example there is a correlation between say Dalits and extreme poverty, then you need to have targeted policies to benefit the Dalits. There is no talk at all about taking money away from anyone else. If it turns out that the Dalits are hugely rich, there are still good arguments for them to get a reservation because they have suffered 3,000 years of discrimination.\n\nSo, it is not that there is an automatic policy that is going to follow from discovering what you are and how much you have, but the expression that Rahul Gandhi used was to say look, we need to know what the real picture is. Just as you take an ""x-ray"" to find out what really is there inside you, let us see what there really is inside our country, not inside your home or inside your cupboard, inside our country. It is a macro picture we are talking about and the Prime Minister is suggesting there is going to be some raid on people\'s things.\n\nThe same Prime Minister has said this party has been ruling for so many years, has done nothing, this is one of the things we have not done. We have done a lot of good things that he has not given us credit for. We do not want credit for something we have never done. We have never raided people\'s homes and taken away their money and we have no plans to do that now either.\n\nThen, how do you explain a senior leader from your party, you know him well, Manish Tewari, he is your candidate from Chandigarh, tweeting this. I am going to quote him: ""We will not allow 1% people to hold 77% of India\'s wealth. Jab paisa bate ek samaan, tabhi hoga Bharat Mahaan.""\n\nShashi Tharoor: As far as I am concerned, Manish can explain his own thinking better than anybody else can, so you can ask him. From my point of view, I think it is merely talking about fairness in our society and that would involve a whole range of economic policies which instead of giving benefits to a small coterie might give benefits to a larger number of people, that is essentially the common sense approach. Congress is a pretty big tent, so there are various schools of economic thought within it. I can say that having served in the manifesto committee under Mr Chidambaram who has shown us his economic approaches as finance minister on two different occasions, in the 90s as well as in UPA, I can tell you that as far as the Congress Party is concerned many of us have strong faith in ourselves as the party of liberalisation.\n\nWe want the economy to grow, but we want the revenues that accrue to the government from a growth in the economy to be distributed to those who are marginalised, oppressed and below the poverty line. There is nothing wrong with that; that is social justice.\n\nThe important thing to recognise is that we are not doing anything to stifle economic growth or the business community, we are the ones who made it possible in the first place under Dr Manmohan Singh\'s finance ministry in 1991 and subsequently reaffirmed that under Dr Manmohan Singh\'s prime ministership from 2004 to 2014.

The 61-year-old BJP leader said the party's tally would be more than 370 seats. Excerpts:\n\nChief minister Siddaramaiah has predicted that NDA's tally won't cross 220 seats. Your take?\n\nLet him first say how many seats Congress, which at one point had 404 MPs, has contested. Now, he is predicting NDA's seats. I can confidently say that BJP will cross 370 seats and NDA 400.\n\nWould the Supreme Court ruling on electoral bonds and comments on delay in releasing drought relief to Karnataka influence voters?\n\nPeople are aware of facts on the issue. Donations have been made not just to BJP but also to Congress, Trinamool Congress and other regional parties. SC has ruled its discontinuation and we have honoured that. But electoral bonds helped political donations with white money. How did Congress manage in the past 60 years? The entire election was funded with black money. If they call this a scam, why did Congress, Trinamool and regional parties accept donations through electoral bonds? These are questions they have not answered.\n\nHave you given up on electoral bonds? Would you explore parliamentary legislation to overcome the court's ruling?\n\nThe judgment came around the time of elections. We are not challenging the judgment, but we will see how we can improve the system of political funding.\n\nDelhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been in jail. Won't that create sympathy for AAP in Delhi where BJP holds all seven seats?\n\nI don't think Kejriwal will get any sympathy. He landed in jail only after he avoided nine summons from ED. The case is so strong that a former deputy CM and a former minister have not got bail even after one year. People know our judiciary is strong and independent. All courts have rejected their bail. People know prima facie there is a case. It will not have an impact on polls. We will retain all seven seats in Delhi.\n\nWho do you consider BJP's opponent at the national level?\n\nWe are fighting different parties in different states. It's Congress in Karnataka, SP in Uttar Pradesh, LDF and UDF in Kerala, DMK in Tamil Nadu, etc. There is nothing called the INDI alliance. It is a gone case.\n\nBJP lost its only state (Karnataka) in the south in last year's assembly polls. Doesn't that make the Lok Sabha polls a challenging one?\n\nIf you recollect, we had a similar situation in 2014. Siddaramaiah formed the government in 2013 after Congress got full majority. In the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, he was confident that Congress would win 20 seats. But what happened? The same will repeat this time too. Voters in states may give a different mandate in assembly elections, but when it comes to the country, they want Modi and BJP. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, we will make inroads. We have an alliance in Andhra Pradesh. In Telangana, we will win 7-8 seats on our own. In Karnataka, we will win at least 25 seats. In the south, our tally will increase without doubt.\n\nDo you think things have improved for BJP in Karnataka in just one year?\n\nLast year's polls were for assembly. It was fought on state issues and there was anti-incumbency. But when it comes to Modi, there is no anti-incumbency.\n\nCM Siddaramaiah says the PM started talking on communal lines after the first phase of polling...\n\nIt started with Congress recommend- ation for inclusion of all Muslims in the OBC list. And Rahul (Gandhi) spoke about redistribution of wealth after phase 1. Naturally, we had to figure out what he was trying to convey and his intentions. On that basis we are talking.\n\nWhat is BJP's message to Muslims?\n\nNDA government's programmes were meant for all including Muslims. The abolition of (instant) triple talaq, for instance, was done in the interest of Muslim women. Congress says BJP is anti-Muslim, but what has Congress given the community over the 60 years? The party used them as a vote bank, kept them educationally backward. Muslims should realise Congress and regional parties are duping them.\n\nTop Congress leaders are saying that BJP will change Constitution if it is voted to power again...\n\nThat is a bogus allegation. It was the PM who started celebrating November 26 as Constitution Day. All important places connected with Dr Ambedkar were developed by Modi. It was Congress that went against Constitution and dismissed one government every 18 months.\n\nKarnataka received a part of drought relief after it approached SC. Isn't that a setback for BJP?\n\nI don't see it as a setback. The process takes time in government and this was the case even when Congress was in power. After the state government gave its representation, the electoral code of conduct kicked in. We requested ECI to give permission. In the meanwhile, they (govt) went to court. We can share figures about how much the state requested when UPA was in power and how much was released. Compare that with the requests made and the funds released during the 10 years under Modi."""

He is a bachelor, he should not be giving advice on marriage and relationships.

Sources suggest the party aimed to avoid alienating Vokkaliga voters, predominant in phase 1, due to tensions with the Kurubas, represented by CM Siddaramaiah. The Gowda family, including Prajwal, holds significant influence among the Vokkaliga community, a TOI report stated.\n\nFollowing elections in southern Karnataka, where three members of the Gowda family contested, Siddaramaiah\'s government established a Special Investigation Team (SIT). Prajwal, the grandson of former PM HD Deve Gowda, is seeking re-election from Hassan as an NDA candidate, while his father, HD Revanna, serves as a JD(S) MLA for Holenarsipur. Both were named in an FIR filed recently, alleging sexual harassment by a former domestic help and her daughter.\n\nCritics question why government intervention occurred only after voting concluded, allowing Prajwal to depart the country, despite the widespread circulation of video clips on pen drives before April 26.\n\nThe BJP has accused Revanna of having friendly ties with politicians, influencing the government\'s actions. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi stated, ""To cover up its lapse, the state government is blaming the Union government... None of us have opposed Prajwal\'s suspension from the party. Still, Congress is blaming NDA.""\n\nAddressing a rally in Kalaburagi, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi questioned PM Narendra Modi\'s silence on the matter, highlighting the BJP and JD(S)\'s alliance in these elections.

Karnataka crucial for BJP\'s South India strategy with JD(S) alliance aiming for 20 seats.The BJP and its ally in Karnataka, JD(S), have landed in a tough situation with allegations of sexual harassment against JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda\'s grandson Prajwal Revanna who is also the sitting MP from Hassan. There are claims of thousands of sex videos of Revanna doing the rounds. An FIR has been filed against Revanna and his father HD Revanna in connection with the sexual harassment case at the Holenarasipur police station based on a complaint by their former house help. Revanna has reportedly fled to Germany.\n\nThe Congress is trying to make the most out of the situation. Laxmi Hebbalkar, the women and child welfare minister of Karnataka, accused the BJP leadership of shielding Revanna in the sex scandal case for political gain. She urged the BJP leaders to clarify their stance on the scandal and whether they will continue their alliance with JD(S), despite the exposure of such a huge scandal.\n\nHow the BJP and JDS r reacted\n\nDays after the sexual harassment case was filed against Revanna, the party has suspended him today until the SIT investigation is concluded. The state government has formed an SIT to probe the case. HD Kumaraswamy, former chief minister of Karnataka and Janata Dal (Secular) leader, said during the JD(S) Core Committee meeting on Tuesday, ""Prajwal Revanna\'s suspension is till the investigation is completed.""\n\nThe JD(S) leader said that his party and family are not accountable for Revanna\'s actions. ""...We are not going to protect him, we will take severe action but the government\'s responsibility is more,"" Kumaraswamy said, adding that further details will be shared after the JD(S) Core Committee meeting. Kumaraswamy clarified that he is not seeking protection for Revanna and urged the Karnataka government to uncover the truth behind the issue. He stressed that the government must expose the real picture and ground reality, not him.\n\nThe BJP has distanced itself from Revanna amid the controversy. Union minister Pralhad Joshi has commented that Revanna\'s case won\'t cause any setback for NDA candidates in elections. Joshi pressed for punishment for offenders. ""Anyway, Congress is in power in the state. Let them act against offenders as per the law,"" he added.\n\nWhen asked in Guwahati today about the allegations against Prajwal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, ""It cannot be tolerated."" He also said that since law and order is a state issue why the Congress government in Karnataka did not take any action till now. He said the BJP and JD(S) are in favour of investigation into the case.\n\nWhy JDS matters in Karnataka\n\nKarnataka plays a key role in the BJP\'s strategy to cross the 50-seat mark in South India. Karnataka is the only state in South India where the BJP has gained dominance. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 25 seats out of the total 28, with a vote share of 51.38%. Though the BJP aims to make a clean sweep in Karnataka this time, it does not seem to be on a stronger wicket. It had lost the assembly elections to the Congress last year, though voter preference could reflect differently in state elections and Lok Sabha elections.\n\nIn 2019, when it made a near-clean sweep, the BJP had fought against an alliance of the Congress and the JD(S). This time it chose to ally with the JD(S) which indicates it doesn\'t want to take any chances and needs help from the JD(S) in southern Karnataka where the regional party has influence among voters, especially the vokkaliga community.\n\nDespite the combined efforts of these two parties, which have a strong voter base in the southern part of the state, BJP had managed to make substantial gains in southern Karnataka in 2019. But political dynamics have undergone a significant shift with the BJP forging an alliance with the JD(s) to take on a resurgent Congress, which has been emboldened by its remarkable victory in the 2023 assembly polls. The JD(S)-BJP partnership is relying on a seamless transfer of votes between the parties in south Karnataka to reach their goal of 20 seats.\n\nMany think the BJP\'s alliance with the JD(S) is a step towards capturing the JD(S)\'s own voter base in the Vokkaliga community and eventually turn Karnataka into a two-party state.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)'"

Joshi believes his strong rapport with the electorate, developmental initiatives, unblemished reputation, and approachable demeanour stand him in good stead this time around, too. In an interview with TOI, he dismisses the significance of the Congress poll guarantees in influencing voter sentiments.Following are excerpts from a free-wheeling interaction:\n\nHow confident are you of securing a fifth consecutive win?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 I'm fully confident of victory because I've worked honestly for the growth of the constituency. As a minister in [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi's cabinet, I've managed the ministry efficiently, leaving no room for corruption. I've upgraded more than 700 govt schools in my constituency.\n\nThere are reports that you leveraged Lingayat leaders within the BJP to get Dingaleshwar Swami to withdraw from the race ...\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 No comments on that.\n\nSwamiji had charged that you marginalised and disrespected Lingayat leaders. Former CM Jagadish Shettar, too, had made similar allegations.\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 I haven't marginalised or disrespected any Lingayat leader. I prioritise unity across communities. In my constituency, all four MLAs are from Lingayat community, demonstrating our inclusivity. Both district presidents are also Lingayats. I value the blessings of all communities, including Lingayats, who have consistently supported me. Shettar hasn't made any such allegation. It's not true.\n\nWill the murder of Neha Hiremath have an impact on electoral outcomes in North Karnataka?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 We, the BJP, prioritise humanitarian values over electoral gains. In the case of Neha's murder, despite her father's political affiliation (Congress), I sought justice. I urged chief minister Siddaramaiah to establish a fast-track court and transfer the case to CBI, respecting the family's wishes. While the state govt treated it lightly, we insisted on an independent investigation. Our commitment to victims transcends politics, we stand by them, combating injustice even beyond elections.\n\nDo you think the Congress guarantee schemes will affect the BJP's poll prospects?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 Guarantee schemes won't sway our poll prospects. Thousands of women attended our poll rallies despite the heatwave, suggesting they were backing us. People prioritise PM Modi for the nation, not guarantees.\n\nIf you're re-elected, what are your plans for Dharwad Lok Sabha seat?\n\n\xe2\x96\xa0 I want to focus on industrial growth, develop the complete Hubballi-Ankola rail line, and develop the Tadadi-Belekeri port, which will attract more investors. We've also done a lot to create infrastructure facilities, including introducing a Vande Bharat Express and taking up airport expansion work to increase flight numbers."""
213,213,"b'Congress targets 20 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka to consolidate power post-assembly success and combat potential challenges from BJP-JD(S) coalition. Emphasis on North Karnataka polls and support from diverse communities.The Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka have emerged as a litmus test for Congress as the results will not only be a referendum on its governance and guarantee schemes but also potentially influence its political stability.\n\nCongress has set itself a formidable target of clinching at least 20 of the 28 Lok Sabha segments in the state -- a massive leap up from the one seat it won in 2019.This ambitious goal is aimed at reinforcing the party\'s hold in Karnataka, following its success in last year\'s assembly elections. A shortfall could potentially embolden the BJP-JD(S) coalition to challenge the state govt\'s stability.\n\nOf particular significance is the second phase of parliamentary elections, which cover regions dominated by the Lingayat community such as Kittur and Kalyana Karnataka, and parts of central Karnataka. Congress has historically fared poorly here and is now under immense pressure to reverse this trend.\n\nTest of welfare schemes\n\nLok Sabha elections are a andate for the Union govt, but results will hold a mirror to the performance of our state govt,"" chief minister Siddaramaiah admitted in an interview with TOI. ""We are confident people are satisfied with our welfare initiatives including the five guarantees. There are ongoing attempts by BJP and JD(S) to bring down our govt, but we expect to emerge stronger.""\n\nIn last year\'s polls, Congress made strategic efforts to engage with the Lingayat community especially after BJP sidelined prominent figures like BS Yediyurappa, Jagadish Shettar and Laxman Savadi. This outreach proved fruitful as the party secured victory in 66 of the 94 assembly segments in the region, garnering an average vote share of 52%.\n\nTremendous response\n\nBasavaraj Rayareddi, chairman, Congress\' campaign for the second phase, expressed confidence in replicating their 2023 performance, citing support from other dominant communities such as OBCs and minorities, in addition to Lingayats.\n\n""The response to our phase-2 campaign has been tremendous,"" Rayareddi said. ""We are confident of winning at least 10 of the 14 seats that went to the polls in phase-1 on April 26 and our performance is expected to be even stronger in North Karnataka in Tuesday\'s polls."" Phase-1 covered segments in South Karnataka which is dominated by the Vokkaliga community and where Congress traditionally fares better.\n\nWith Karnataka one of only two major states where it is in govt, the party is placing significant emphasis on its state unit to enhance its representation at the national level. Having failed twice to secure the necessary numbers to become the principal opposition party in the Lok Sabha, the primary goal is to increase its own seat count while also aiming for a majority for the INDIA bloc.\n\nHOW BJP\'S DOMINANCE GREW\n\nRiding on the positive atmosphere created by the nationwide Ram Mandir movement and the Idgah Maidan controversy in Hubballi, BJP, for the first time, won four seats. Congress registered its lowest-ever tally until then, winning just two seats. The party faced the wrath of Lingayats after Veerendra Patil, a member of the community, was unceremoniously sacked from the chief minister post by Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Lingayats, who influence election outcomes owing to their population in North Karnataka, threw their weight behind Janata Dal, helping it win seven seats.\n\nIn 1998, strong signs emerged of BJP emerging as an alternative to both Congress and the Janata Dal in North Karnataka. After becoming Prime Minister in 1996 and taking total control of Janata Dal, HD Deve Gowda got his political foe, Ramakrishna Hegde, expelled from the party. This angered Lingayats, who considered Hegde their unquestionable leader. Miffed, Hegde floated the Lok Shakti party and fought the 1998 elections as an ally of BJP. While BJP won six seats, Lok Shakti bagged three. Janata Dal drew a blank.\n\nJanata Dal underwent a vertical split -- JDU and JD(S) -- just a few weeks ahead of the Lok Sabha and assembly elections. Vokkaligas consolidated behind HD Deve Gowda-led JD(S), and Lingayats consolidated behind JDU under the leadership of JH Patel. Hegde dissolved Lok Shakti and teamed up with JDU. BJP and JDU won four and one seat respectively. Their tally fell owing to strong antiincumbency against the Janata Dal govt led by Patel.\n\nBJP\'s electoral fortunes in North Karnataka saw a huge surge as the saffron party won 11 of 14 seats. A huge reason for this is by the time polls were held, JDU had weakened with the deaths of stalwarts JH Patel (2000) and Ramakrishna Hegde (2004), thus ceding space to BJP. Lingayats, who had no political leader from their own community to fall back on, gravitated towards BJP. The saffron party also received a big boost with chief minister S Bangarappa joining the party just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. It helped BJP expand its voter base to backward classes.\n\nWith no third player in the fray to eat into its voter base, especially among Lingayats, BJP\'s supremacy over Congress only grew. The denial of transfer of the chief ministership to BJP by JD(S) -- as agreed on between HD Kumaraswamy and BS Yediyurappa in 2006 when they formed the govt in the state -- further fuelled consolidation of Lingayats behind BJP. This resulted in the party winning the assembly elections in 2008. Some 52 influential political functionaries, including Basavaraj Bommai, CM Udasi, and Prabhakar Kore, quit their respective parties and joined BJP. The emergence of the Reddy brothers and B Sriramulu, a popular ST leader, helped the party strengthen its position in the region.\n\nWith the rise of Narendra Modi as BJP\'s prime ministerial candidate and the wave his name created across the country, BJP continuing its winning streak was not unexpected. It won 11 of 14 seats. Though it dropped one to Congress, its performance in the region was still considered top draw as it came after the party\'s humiliating defeat in the assembly elections just a year previously and the turmoil it witnessed from within in the preceding years. The illegal mining scam saw five BJP ministers, including Yediyurappa and mining baron Janardhan Reddy, being jailed, which only brought disrepute to the party. The party also split, with Yediyurappa floating his own and ensuring BJP\'s defeat in the assembly elections.\n\nRiding high on PM Modi\'s popularity and strong sentiments of nationalism following the Pulwama attack and the subsequent surgical strike, BJP swept the region, winning all 14 seats. The election saw even current AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge suffering his first-ever defeat in his four-decade political career. The anger among people, especially Lingayats, against Congress and JD(S) for forming a coalition govt and thus denying Yediyurappa the CM post despite BJP emerging the single-largest party, also played a major role in the rout of both Congress and JD(S). The lack of coordination among both parties also helped BJP\'s cause.\n\nBJP faces a strong wave of anti-incumbency in eight seats and rebels in two\n\nFor years, North Karnataka has been a bastion of BJP, largely due to the unwavering support of the Lingayat community and the powerful nationalistic image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP candidates have enjoyed consistent electoral success across the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the region.\n\nBut Congress, spearheaded by CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar, engineered a remarkable resurgence in last year\'s assembly polls. It transformed political dynamics in the region.\n\nThe implementation of the party\'s election promises, including fulfilment of the five guarantee schemes, has strengthened its position, posing a formidable challenge to BJP\'s entrenched dominance.\n\nDirect fight\n\nBJP\'s pact with JD(S) will matter little since the regional outfit does not hold much sway here. Therefore, the electoral battle is a direct fight between BJP and Congress.\n\nBJP won all 14 seats in the region in 2019, 11 seats in the 2014 elections and 12 in 2009. If it is to continue to dominate, it must secure all 14 seats. This is crucial for BJP both nationally and within the state.\n\nWinning these seats would not only strengthen the party\'s position but it would also help BJP state president BY Vijayendra assert his leadership credentials, particularly in the wake of his father and Lingayat strongman BS Yediyurappa\'s departure from active politics. There is also significant dissent against him.\n\nOf the 14 constituencies up for grabs, eight feature Lingayat candidates, highlighting the community\'s influence. But, BJP faces considerable challenges, particularly in key constituencies like Shimoga, Belgaum, Dharwad, Gulbarga, and Uttara Kannada.\n\nRetaining the Shimoga seat, held by BY Raghavendra, Vijayendra\'s brother, poses a big -- and crucial -- challenge, especially with former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa contesting as a rebel. He is aiming to uproot dynastic politics within BJP. In Belgaum, BJP has strategically fielded Jagadish Shettar, a former CM, hoping to regain support from Lingayat voters who had looked the other way in last year\'s assembly elections.\n\nAnger & dissent\n\nIn Dharwad, Lingayats are incensed with Union minister Pralhad Joshi, posing a threat to his incumbency. Similarly, in Uttara Kannada, the replacement of Anantkumar Hegde with Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri has stirred controversy, with Hegde\'s decision not to campaign for Kageri further complicating matters.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s efforts to galvanise support, particularly by dwelling on issues like the Neha Hiremath murder and promoting anti-Muslim narratives, BJP confronts strong anti-incumbency sentiments in eight of the 14 seats. Rebel candidates pose challenges in two seats, further complicating BJP\'s electoral prospects.\n\nThe fate of senior BJP candidates such as Ramesh Jigajinagi, PC Gaddigoudar, Raja Amareshwara Naik, and Gayathri Siddeshwar hangs in the balance.

During the Congress regime, 60,000km of highways were constructed, while Atal Bihari Vajapayee\'s regime saw the construction of 30,000km of highways in just five years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his 10-year tenure has ensured that 60,000km of highways including four lanes, six lanes, eight lanes and ten lanes are constructed, he asserted.\n\nReferring to India\'s security forces, Joshi said at present the country can enter the terrorist hubs from the front and demolish them. ""Earlier, there used to be serial bomb blasts and innocents were being killed by the terrorists. India\'s reaction was to light a candle to mourn the dead and keep quiet. Now it is different.

Despite initial resistance from the local BJP unit to shift him from Dharwad to Belagavi, he appears to have quelled dissent and established rapport with voters. In an interview with TOI, Shettar exuded confidence in overcoming obstacles and securing victory.Excerpts:\n\nWhat makes you confident of winning and what aspects of your party attract voters?\n\nI am confident of my victory, given the prevailing sentiment to grant PM Modi a third term owing to his extensive achievements. Furthermore, my longstanding 30-year association with Belagavi, coupled with my collaboration with the late Belgaum MP Suresh Angadi, has bolstered BJP's presence in the region and significantly contributed to its holistic development during my tenure as CM and minister.\n\nThere are concerns within BJP about a potential division among Lingayat voters, particularly amidst debates surrounding Laxmi Hebbalkar's affiliation with the Panchamasali subsect...\n\nWe're focusing our election campaign on national issues such as integrity, safety, and security. Caste doesn't play a role in our approach, and I refrain from commenting or engaging in discussions regarding caste or subsect matters. Our priority is to highlight Modi's achievements and address national concerns.\n\nThere were reports of opposition from some local BJP leaders to your candidature since they regarded you as an outsider\n\nThere was no such discontent or disagreement within the party or among local leaders about my candidature. It was Congress that attempted to fabricate this discontent or differences.\n\nWill the Neha Hiremath and Prajwal cases influence voter sentiment?\n\nWhile the Neha and Prajwal cases may be topics of debate, they will not impact voter decisions.\n\nHow do you reconcile your past criticism of Union minister Pralhad Joshi when you left BJP to join Congress, with your\n\ndecision to join forces with him when he sought to file his nomination?\n\nI have never opposed Joshi nor made any statements against him. Therefore, there is no basis for a debate on this matter. Joshi and I have never been in conflict, and we share a good positive relationship that will continue. Following party discipline, I went with him to file nomination papers.\n\nIf elected, what is your vision for Belgaum?\n\nMy objective is to elevate the Belagavi airport to international standards and finalise all ongoing railway projects, including the Dharwad-Belgaum line via Kittur. I aim to draw significant industries to Belagavi, generating employment for locals. This involves establishing an IT cluster, fostering pharmaceutical industries, and creating textile parks in rural regions alongside agro-based industries."""

Both have been named in an FIR in which a former housemaid accused the father-son duo of sexually harassing her and daughter.\n\nThis delayed action has led to a war of words between Congress and BJP, especially since BJP and JD(S) are allies for LS polls in which the junior partner is contesting from three seats. Priyanka Gandhi, in Kalaburagi on Monday, questioned PM Modi\'s silence on the issue. In response, Union home minister Amit Shah fastened the responsibility on the Congress-led state govt. ""It is a very serious issue, and we cannot tolerate it. We want to ask why Congress, despite being in power in Karnataka, hasn\'t acted yet? Priyanka should ask CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar,"" he said.\n\nCongress waiting for the first phase of voting to be over is attributed to political arithmetic. Congress, according to sources, did not want to alienate the Vokkaliga voters, who were dominant in Phase 1, especially given their antipathy to Kurubas. As Siddaramaiah is a Kuruba, it would have looked like a Kuruba CM had gone after the first family of Vokkaligas.\n\nS ources said the govt could not have booked a case without a bona-fide complaint from victims. Shah insulated the Centre from any likely negative fallout, saying a law-and-order issue falls in the state\'s domain and clarified the BJP ""is in favour of investigations being conducted by SIT set up by the state govt"". Akhila Vidyasagar, core committee member of Karnataka Mahila Dourjanya Virodhi Okkoota, which submitted a memorandum to ECI and the women\'s commission, said the govt should have been ""swift"" in action.\n\n""The main question is why did the authorities remain mute spectators when the victims were airing their grievances in many fora... for more than a year now?""

Scindia, who was with the Congress till 2020, represented the Guna constituency from 2002 to 2019. Scindia\'s grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia and father Madhavrao Scindia, too, represented Guna in the Lok Sabha\n\nMainpuri (Uttar Pradesh): The Yadav family ""bahu"" and incumbent MP Dimple Yadav will face her first litmus test from the SP stronghold, two years after she recorded a landslide victory in the bypolls following the death of Mulayam Singh Yadav. In the 2024 election, Dimple finds herself in a face-off against BJP\'s Jaiveer Singh, who is the tourism minister in the UP government. BSP\'s Shiv Prasad Yadav is also into the fray, further queering the pitch. The emphasis on Yadav identity by BSP candidate might pose a challenge to Dimple, who comes from a Rajput background and married Akhilesh Yadav in November 1999.\n\nRajgarh (Madhya Pradesh): Former MP CM Digvijaya Singh, who won the elections from the constituency way back in 1984 and then in 1991, has returned to his home turf after three decades. Digvijaya is the son of Balbhadra Singh, the Raja of Raghogarh (under the Gwalior State). Interestingly, he said that it would be the ""last election of his life"". And to end his electoral career on a winning note, Digvijaya will have to see off a stiff challenge from BJP\'s two-time MP Rodmal Nagar. In 2019, Nagar defeated his Congress rival by a commanding margin of over 4.3 lakh votes and is a formidable opponent. But Congress is banking on Digvijaya\'s deep-rooted connection with Rajgarh to reclaim its erstwhile bastions from BJP.\n\nVidisha (Madhya Pradesh): Like Digvijaya Singh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan - another former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh - is hoping to make a mark in the 2024 Lok Sabha election after returning to his home turf of Vidisha. Last year, Chouhan had to sacrifice the CM post for Mohan Yadav after BJP won the 2023 Madhya Pradesh elections. There was a buzz that he may be given an important national role. In 2024, he is now the BJP candidate from Vidisha, a constituency he has won as many as five times from 1991 to 2004. He will face veteran Congress leader and former Vidisha MP Pratap Bhanu Sharma. The high-profile constituency holds special significance for the BJP, as it was previously represented in the lower house by the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the late former foreign minister Sushma Swaraj.\n\nDharwad (Karnataka): Union minister Pralhad Joshi is hoping to win the constituency for a record fifth time in a direct clash with Congress. The prospects of Joshi, who has been the MP from Dharwad since 2004, improved significantly after popular Lingayat seer Dingaleshwar Swamiji of Shirahatti Bhavaikya Peetha withdrew his candidature just weeks before the polling. Joshi has won all four elections with a comfortable margin against the Congress candidates. In the 2019 polls, he secured victory with a margin of just over 2 lakh votes against Vinay Kulkarni of Congress. In 2024, Joshi is facing a challenge from Congress\'s Vinod Asooti.\n\nShivamogga (Karnataka): The contest between the children of two former chief ministers and the presence of an expelled BJP leader in the fray has spiced up the poll scene in Karnataka\'s Shimoga Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP has renominated MP and Yediyurappa\'s son B Y Raghavendra. The Congress has named Bangarappa\'s daughter Geetha Shivarajkumar, who is the wife of Karnataka film star Shivarajkumar and daughter-in-law of Kannada thespian late Rajkumar. While the stage was almost set for a direct clash between Raghavendra and Geetha Shivrajkumar, BJP veteran K S Eshwarappa rebelled against the party over the denial of ticket to his son K E Kantesh from neighbouring Haveri. The former deputy CM has entered the fray as an independent, making it a keen triangular clash.\n\nDhubri (Assam): AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal is locked in a triangular contest to retain the seat for the fourth consecutive term. However, Ajmal, who has dominated the minority-dominated constituency for years, may face tough competition from Congress nominee and former minister Rakibul Hussain and NDA nominee Zabed Islam of the Asom Gana Parishad. Both contenders allege that the AIUDF supremo has failed to deliver on all fronts and is banking on the anti-incumbency factor to wrest the seat. Issues like floods, erosion, poverty and child marriage have dominated the poll narrative in the run up to the elections.\n\nNorth Goa (Goa): Union minister Shripad Naik has been representing the North Goa constituency since 1999 (formerly Panaji constituency) and is looking to clinch a record sixth term. In 2019, he defeated Congress\'s Girish Chodankar by a margin of over 80,000 votes. This time, Congress has nominated veteran politician and former Union law minister Ramakant Khalap from the constituency. Khalap, 76, has a rich political history, having served as an MP on the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) ticket from 1996-1998 and as Union MoS for Law in Rajiv Gandhi\'s cabinet before joining Congress.'"

238,238,"b'The sex scandal allegedly involving Prajwal, who left for Germany early on April 27, provided ammunition to the Congress, which rules the state, to counter the BJP national leadership\'s attacks on issues like ""minority appeasement"" and the murder of a Lingayat college girl Neha Hiremath in Hubballi allegedly by her estranged Muslim friend.\n\nTop Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called Prajwal a ""mass rapist"" during a rally in Raichur on May 2, accusing the BJP leadership of being allegedly aware of the JD(S) MP\'s alleged sex crimes when he was given a poll ticket by its NDA ally.\n\nThe sex scandal itself is however believed to have no bearing, on the ground, on the poll outcome in the three regions bound for Tuesday voting - the Lingayat-dominated Bombay Karnataka (five seats), the impoverished Hyderabad-Karnataka region (five seats), the agricultural central districts (three seats), and one coastal district, Uttara Kannada, which is known for being a Hindutva bastion.\n\nAcross these regions there seems to be an atmosphere of ""strong anti-incumbency"" against the 14 sitting BJP MPs, who are said to be entirely dependent on the Modi factor to sail through, but face challenges even in the pro-BJP Lingayat region of Bombay Karnataka as well as Uttara Kannada.\n\nIn Bombay Karnataka, the Modi factor coupled with the Lingayat community\'s traditional support for the BJP is likely to deliver most of the five seats to the BJP with the Congress appearing to have an edge mainly in the Chikkodi seat.\n\nIn the Hyderabad Karnataka region, where livelihood concerns seem to have trumped nationalistic and religious identity issues, the Congress is seen to have an upper hand in at least three of the five seats due to its ""pro-poor policies"".\n\nThe Gulbarga seat in Hyderabad Karnataka, where the prestige of Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge is at stake, is set to witness a tough fight as local issues involving caste pride have now gained precedence over the Kharge factor.\n\nThe three central Karnataka seats of Davangere, Haveri and Shivamogga will see close contests although the BJP is considered to have an edge in former chief minister B S Yediyurappa\'s Shivamogga turf since the polls featuring Yediyurappa\'s elder son B Y Raghavendra involves the prestige of the Lingayat strongman and his younger son B Y Vijayendra, the state BJP chief.\n\nIn Davangere and Shivamogga, the presence of rebel OBC candidates from the BJP - who may split the votes of the Kuruba community which is allied to Congress CM Siddaramaiah - would make the contests keener.\n\nBJP rebel K S Eshwarappa has thrown his hat in the ring in Shivamogga.\n\nThe BJP\'s former CM Basavaraj Bommai is contesting the Haveri seat while another ex-CM Jagadish Shettar is testing the ground in Belagavi as the BJP nominee following a brief stint with the Congress during which he lost on its ticket from the Hubballi Central Assembly seat in the 2023 polls.\n\nAbout half a dozen relatives of the Congress ministers and leaders - including Kharge\'s son-in-law Radhakrishna Doddamani - are in the fray on the Congress tickets, with the party depending on the implementation of its 2023 poll guarantees to deliver the electoral dividends.\n\n""In both phases of the polls the guarantees have had an impact on the people. This is because all the guarantees have been implemented within eight months of our government coming to power. People have a sense of belief and confidence in the guarantees,"" Siddaramaiah said.\n\n""We will win all five seats in the Kalyana Karnataka region (Hyderabad Karnataka),"" state Congress chief D K Shivakumar said.\n\nIn 2019, the Congress had won just one of the state\'s 28 seats as against the BJP\'s 25. The party is however claiming that it would win most of the seats this time.\n\nKarnataka has a tradition of the party in power bagging a majority of the seats, barring 1983 and 1998 as well as 2014 and 2019 amid the Modi wave.\n\nCurrently, several BJP veterans are in contention in the second phase, including Anna Saheb Jolle from Chikodi, P C Gaddigoudar from Bagalkot and Ramesh Jigjinagi from Bijapur.\n\nIn Hubballi-Dharwad, four-time BJP MP and Union minister Pralhad Joshi is taking on young Congress leader Vinod Asooti. The BJP\'s campaign over the Neha Hiremath murder case is likely to help Joshi clinch a fifth term despite anti-incumbency.\n\nPM Modi himself campaigned in Karnataka for the second phase only on two days covering five constituencies - Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, Davangere and Ballari on April 28 and Bagalkot on April 29.'"

246,246,"b'At 4.30pm on April 18, Neha Hiremath, a first-year Master\'s student of computer application was walking towards the college gates of the BV Bhoomaraddi campus of the KLE Technological University, where her mother was waiting to pick her up. On the way, the young woman was accosted by 23-year-old Fayaz Khondunaik, a former classmate who had dropped out of the course. As CCTV recordings captured images that would shock a state, Khondunaik brandished a knife and stabbed Hiremath six times. He fled, only to be arrested later that day. Hiremath was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.\n\nKarnataka went into uproar with sweeping street protests and candle-light vigils. Hiremath\'s family is influential -- her father Niranjan Hiremath is a Congress corporator of the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation. Within hours, the killing tipped into politics and religion. Khondunaik was Muslim, Hiremath a Hindu. This sparked talk of ""love jihad"", a term that has no legal or government sanction is often used by Hindu right-wing groups to describe relationships involving Muslim men and Hindu women.\n\nIn the three weeks since, the BJP has spoken of Hiremath\'s shocking murder extensively in its campaign. On April 29, at a rally in neighbouring Belagavi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""What happened with our daughter in a college campus in Hubbali shook the entire nation. They don\'t value the lives of our daughters such as Neha. All they care about is their vote bank... ever since the Congress government came to Karnataka, the law and order has deteriorated significantly."" The death has become one of the sharpest points in the BJP\'s campaign to defend its Lok Sabha citadel.\n\nKarnataka is no stranger to political battle lines being drawn over religion. It\'s a state where the history of Tipu Sultan is still fiercely contested in election campaigns; where girl students wearing the Hijab in educational institutions sparked a turmoil and tumult for almost two years; where even cosmopolitan urban centres such as Mangaluru have a history of moral policing laced with religious conservatism.\n\nYet, the row has put into spotlight phenomenon of splinter communal issues - many of them framed around dubious claims such as ""love jihad"" - being fanned by fringe groups and increasingly entering the political mainstream, and its devastating effect on the local social fabric.\n\nThe Hiremath home in Bidnal is two storeys tall, accessible only through a maze of narrow alleys, all at right angles to each other. To its right and to its left are rows and rows of the same kind of two-storey homes -- flat concrete terraces that overlook endless agricultural fields where the urban squalor ends; some populated by sugarcane stalk, others where sunflowers sway gently in the summer breeze.\n\nSince April 18, the stream of visitors who have navigated the thin alleys of Bidnal has been incessant. BJP chief JP Nadda came on April 21, and Union home minister Amit Shah 10 days later. Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah came on April 25, and state women and child development minister Laxmi Hebbalkar on April 20, two days after the death.\n\nFor the first few days after his daughter\'s killing, an inconsolable father publicly said that he believed that it was a case of ""love jihad"", accusing the state police of botching the investigation, and praising Modi for mentioning his daughter\'s case.\n\nThe Congress scrambled into damage control, and underlined that Khondunaik was arrested, and that investigations were underway. On April 23, after Siddaramaiah spoke to him over the phone and multiple ministerial delegations visited, Hiremath seemed to step back, apologising for his comments against the state government. ""I expressed doubts over the inquiry, but it has turned out that the police have done their job properly. I apologise for my words, which was the result of misinformation,"" he said.\n\nHours before Dharwad voted on Tuesday, Hiremath went a step further, and with minister Laxmi Hebbalkar by his side, sought votes in favour of the Congress.\n\nBut the incident has taken a political life of its own.\n\n""In the Neha Hiremath murder case, we have found direct proof of the love jihad that we have been talking about. Today, all Hindus have become alert. The Congress does too much appeasement of the minority community. It is the scene everywhere wherever the Opposition is in power,"" Lingraj Patil, the BJP in-charge said told HT, adding that this was the single biggest issue in the local campaign.\n\nThe Congress, on its part, accused the BJP of politicising the issue. ""Everything should not be politicised, especially in a case where religion has nothing to do with the crime. A similar instance happened in Mysore where the attacker was not Muslim...this shows that the BJP has no other issues to fight these elections,"" Congress leader Amaan Sait told HT.\n\nIf electoral history is a reliable witness, voters of the twin cities of Hubballi and Dharwad, which lie at the centre of the Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency, need little convincing to vote for the BJP. The party has won this seat since 1996, when it was called Dharwad North. After 2008, the seat was renamed Dharwad and has been held by Union minister Pralhad Joshi.\n\nLocal election watchers point to a seminal few years after 1991, seeped in religious politics, that laid the BJP\'s foundation for dominance. Between 1977 and 1996, it was the Congress that ruled Dharwad. But the early 1990s was a time of tumult in Indian politics, when the Babri Masjid was demolished and a great wave of Mandir politics swept the hinterland. In Dharwad, this took a different form, with a custody battle of sorts for the local Idgah Maidan.\n\nTill then, the open space in the centre of town was used primarily for Muslim gatherings besides sundry uses such as parking and makeshift markets. But for two years between 1992 and 1994, the BJP loudly pushed for opening the maidan to multiple communities, particularly Hindus. On August 15, 1994, a tense state government, then run by the Congress, clamped prohibitory orders, but BJP leader Uma Bharti and her supporters defied the diktat, attempting to forcibly hoist the national flag. A commotion ensued, and the police opened fire. Six died.\n\nIn every Lok Sabha and assembly election since then, the BJP has triumphed. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Joshi won the Dharwad seat by a margin of more than 200,000 votes; while in the assembly polls, the BJP retained both the Hubballi Dharwad West and Hubballi Dharwad Central seats -- two of the three urban seats in the district. Jagadish Shettar, a six time MLA and former BJP chief minister who switched from the BJP to the Congress at the time, lost to a first-timer from the BJP by a bigger margin than he had ever won. He has now quietly returned to the BJP fold.\n\n""The people of this constituency have been voting for the BJP across communities and on issues like Hindutva for decades. This time there is the additional factor of the Ram temple, and now the Neha Hiremath murder,"" said a local resident, who did not want to be named.\n\nOne senior Congress leader admitted that Hiremath\'s murder could cause the party damage, particularly at a time when the state government was seeking to focus on the social guarantees it implemented since 2023, and there was a sense of unease among the BJP\'s oldest vote bank -- the Lingayats. ""After all, Hiremath was a Lingayat,"" he said.\n\nThe summer of 2023 was a chastening time for the Karnataka BJP. It lost its only state government south of the Vindhyas, falling from 104 seats in 2018 to 66 in 2023. There were many post-mortem examinations; blame was laid at the door of the perception that the state government had fallen prey to corruption and that the leadership was uninspiring.\n\nBut for most, the beginning of the fall came in July 2021 when the BJP replaced Lingayat stalwart and then chief minister BS Yediyurappa with Basavraj Bommai, an attempt at a generational change. The move backfired; the Lingayats, who are the largest community in the state, retreated from the BJP. The effects were particularly stark in central and northern Karnataka, especially in districts such as Dharwad where they are close to a quarter of the population. The Congress won four of the seven assembly segments.\n\nIn November, a chastised BJP course-corrected, and BY Vijayendra, Yediyurappa\'s son, became the state unit chief, putting the party\'s first family in the state back in charge. And yet, right until voting day, there is some evidence of continued discomfiture.\n\nOn April 8, Dingaleshwar Swamiji, a popular seer of the Lingayat Shirahatti Fakireshwar Math in Shirahatti outside Hubballi, announced his candidature as an independent against Joshi, accusing him of suppressing the Lingayat community. Two weeks later, on April 23, the seer withdrew.\n\nThe BJP has brushed aside the challenge posed by the Lingayat seer as an underhand attempt by the Congress to split the BJP votes. ""In Hubballi, the Congress has tried to raise issues of caste and to disturb voting patterns on these lines. But it will not work,"" Lingraj Patil said.\n\nThe Congress pick from Dharwad is Vinod Asooti, a Kuruba who is from the same caste as Siddaramaiah, and a first-time contestant. Before this, Asooti unsuccessfully contested the 2018 state assembly elections from the Navalgund seat in north-east Dharwad and is a two-term state district Congress chief. ""The question facing Asooti is how he is going to take on the BJP\'s dominance in the Hubballi Dharwad (West), currently represented by the BJP\'s Arvind Bellad and the Hubballi Dharwad (Central), currently represented by Mahesh Tenginakai, both of which have given a lead of more than 50,000 votes each to Joshi,"" a Congress leader said, requesting anonymity.\n\nA second Congress leader said the AHINDA - a Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits - could help the party. ""Surveys have shown that the Congress guarantees are working and have had a huge impact among rural voters and women voters,"" the leader added, requesting anonymity.\n\nBut in the bylanes of Bidnal, the conversation is far away from any mention of candidates; of Asooti or Joshi; even of Modi or Siddaramaiah. The rumours and allegations around the murder have deepened faith-based fault lines, forced the Muslim community, who form a fifth of the population, into silence, and ratcheted up hostility.\n\n""The murder and the speculation around it has shocked the city and left us with a feeling that no one is safe,"" said Shanmukhappa Basavanneppa Tirlapur, a local school teacher.\n\n""I feel the community is being blamed for the actions of one individual. It was not our fault that the murder happened...unfortunately I can see that people will use this as an excuse to divide us,"" a Muslim rickshaw driver, who declined to be named, said.\n\nOutside Neha Hiremath\'s pale yellow home, too, the mood is sombre. In a plain white shirt, his face sombre and drawn, an elderly relative, who refuses to be named, dreads the weeks to come, and the shrill communal pitch the issue has taken. ""With the voting done, the issue will be forgotten, and the family will be left to bear the loss. Even now, look around you. The media has gone,"" he said. ""But our scars -- those of the family and the community -- will remain.""'"

In an exclusive interview with News18, union minister Pralhad Joshi hinted at this.\n\nWhen asked about the alleged fight over the chief minister\'s chair and where it could head after the Lok Sabha polls, Joshi said, ""Infighting is so much. Siddaramaiah and DKS groups are fighting. Some people want something from the central government against the other group. Siddaramaiah\'s people say he will continue, DK Shivakumar says he will become CM. Daal mein kuch kaala hai (something is fishy),"" he said.\n\nThe minister is eyeing a fifth straight term from the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat in Karnataka and says that his work over the last 20 years will ensure a record election win for him. The date for voting in Dharwad is May 7, which is the third phase of the ongoing general elections.\n\n""UPA used to approve projects and give very small amounts. But under PM Modi we have got everything. We have expanded the airport and are adding a new terminal now. New bypasses are constructed. We have 24\xc3\x977 water for Hubballi-Dharwad and the entire district. We have started Vande Bharat, we can reach Bengaluru in 5.5 hours. We want to take people from Dharwad to Bengaluru in 4 hours. The Hubballi-Ankola railway line will be cleared very shortly. We want to see Hubballi developed in a systematic manner,"" he said.\n\nThe ruling Congress has accused Pralhad Joshi and the BJP of politicising the Neha Hiremath murder case. The young college student was brutally stabbed to death inside her college in Hubballi. The BJP has held several protests over the issue ever since. ""We did not say anything initially. The chief minister\'s reaction was casual and erratic. The father spoke with anger. People said this government may hush up the case and start agitation. We have no role. The entire Dharwad got up and said we won\'t tolerate this; it was a spontaneous thing. The father said my daughter was asked to convert. She said she wouldn\'t, that\'s why she was killed. It was a crisis; we have responded. We don\'t need this type of incident to win. We don\'t do politics on dead bodies,"" argued Pralhad Joshi\n\nThe BJP MP also lashed out at the Congress government in Karnataka, accusing it of moving all Muslim subsects into the reservation matrix. He said the move was part of the Siddaramaiah government\'s appeasement politics. ""I have got the NCBC notice copy. The state government has said the entire Muslim community needs to be added to the OBC. Only some communities were in category A. They have said it\'s neither a caste nor religion. Muslims claim they are a Dharma. Why should all Muslims be given reservation? Even in the Rameshwaram Cafe blast case, they called it a cylinder blast. They don\'t want to say Islamic fundamentalists have done it. They want to support or protect Muslims in such cases,"" Joshi said.\n\nThe Prajwal Revanna sex tape controversy has hit national headlines and many from the Bharatiya Janata Party are worried about any possible impact of it among women voters. Joshi though argued that the row over the now-suspended JD(S) leader will not affect the BJP in any manner. ""The Prajwal Revanna video case and the BJP have no connection. They are our partners now. Let there be an investigation. Let them have their investigation. I don\'t think it will have an impact on the BJP\'s prospects in Karnataka,"" said Joshi.\n\nCheck Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase 3 Schedule, Key Candidates And Constituencies At News18 Website.'"
248,248,"b'Jaishankar confirms receipt of a request to impound the passport of Janata Dal Secular MP Prajwal Revanna, who fled to Germany amid sexual assault allegations\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has confirmed that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) received a request to impound the passport of Janata Dal-Secular MP Prajwal Revanna, who fled to Germany after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him.\n\nThe 33-year-old Prajwal, who is the NDA candidate from the Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing several women. Prajwal reportedly left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls, and is still at large. ""To impound a passport is governed by an act called the Passport Act. We need a judicial court or a police request to do so. The MEA got this request from Karnataka only on May 21,"" Jaishankar said in an exclusive interview with ANI.\n\nA \'Blue Corner Notice\' seeking information on his whereabouts has already been issued by Interpol, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant on May 18 against Prajwal, following an application moved by the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\n\nTrouble mounted on Thursday for Prajwal, with Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the second time to cancel the diplomatic passport of the suspended JD (S) MP, and the MEA saying it was processing the request for revocation of his passport. Meanwhile, former prime minister and Prajwal\'s grandfather Deve Gowda issued a ""stern warning"", asking his grandson to come home and face the matter legally, lest he should face his anger and that of the family members leading to his isolation.\n\nReacting to the Karnataka Chief Minister\'s second missive to the Prime Minister, Union minister Pralhad Joshi said there is a process to cancel the diplomatic passport of Prajwal, and asserted the Centre is ready to cooperate in bringing him back to the country. In New Delhi, official sources said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has received a letter from the Karnataka government seeking revocation of Revanna\'s diplomatic passport.\n\n""The MEA has received a letter from the Karnataka government for cancellation of diplomatic passport in respect of MP Prajwal Revanna. This is being processed,"" a source said. The MEA\'s explanation came in the wake of Siddaramaiah\'s second missive to PM Modi on the issue, urging him to take ""prompt and necessary"" actions to cancel Prajwal\'s diplomatic passport.\n\nIn his letter to Modi, the chief minister said it was ""shameful that Prajwal, a Member of Parliament from Hassan constituency, who is also contesting for re-election in the present general elections, and who is the grandson of a former Prime Minister, fled the country, the 27th of April, 2024 to Germany using his diplomatic passport...shortly after news of his heinous actions emerged and just a few hours before the first FIR was filed against him."" The Chief Minister, who had written to the PM on May 1 on the subject, further said the Karnataka government has taken prompt action to meet the ends of justice by setting up a special team to probe the matter.\n\n(With agency inputs)\n\nExplore in-depth coverage of Lok Sabha Election 2024 Schedule, Voter Turnout, Upcoming Phase And Much More At News18 Website'"
249,249,"b""The BJP and the Congress are locked in a direct fight for the 14 Lok Sabha seats of north Karnataka that will vote on May 7. In 2019, the BJP swept this region, winning all the 14 constituencies, with the Congress suffering a rout even in its traditional heartland of Kalyana Karnataka (the north-eastern division of the State). The JD (S), which is part of the BJP alliance, has not been allotted any seat in north Karnataka, where it has a limited support base.\n\nAmong other issues, the BJP highlighted the murder of a Hindu girl named Neha Hiremath by a Muslim classmate in Hubballi. The BJP's star campaigners, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, also targeted the Congress over issues such as the inheritance tax, even though it has not been mentioned in the Congress manifesto.\n\nThe Congress is hoping to make gains in the part of the State on the back of its implementation of five guarantees. Part of its campaign has also focused on the Prajwal Revanna scandal, with Congress leaders accusing the BJP of endorsing his candidature despite knowing all about his character.\n\nAlso Read | South Karnataka: April 26 to see tough fight for 14 seats\n\nThe incumbents and the challengers\n\nA full list of the constituencies voting on May 7 in Karnataka, with brief details about the candidates, follows:\n\nChikkodi: The BJP has renominated its incumbent MP, Annasaheb Jolle, who, confident of his renomination began his campaign six months ago in this north-west corner of Karnataka. Pitted against him is Priyanka Jarkiholi, a political novice. While the young Congress candidate does not have any political experience, she is the daughter of Karnataka Minister Satish Jarkiholi who, along with his brothers, is a powerhouse in the politics of Karnataka. Jolle is a Lingayat while Jarkiholi is a Valmiki, which is recognised as Scheduled Tribe. Of the eight Assembly constituencies forming part of the Chikkodi parliamentary constituency, five are represented by the Congress while the BJP has three MLAs.\n\nBelagavi: Former Union Minister Suresh Angadi ensured that Belagavi became a BJP fortress by winning from this constituency continuously from 2004. In the byelection that took place after his death, his wife, Mangala Savadi, was victorious in 2021, but this time, the BJP has chosen to field its former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar. Shettar was an aspirant for the neighbouring Dharwad Lok Sabha seat but has been accommodated in Belagavi after he returned from the Congress' fold, which he had joined prior to the Assembly election last year. Shettar is a Lingayat like his Congress opponent, Mrinal Hebbalkar. This will be the first electoral contest for Hebbalkar whose mother, Laxmi Hebbalkar, is a Minister in the Congress government in power in the State.\n\nBagalkot: BJP's four-time winner from this constituency, P.C. Gaddigoudar, takes on political debutant Samyukta Patil of the Congress. Samyukta is the daughter of Shivanand Patil, an incumbent Minister in the Karnataka government, who is putting all his efforts in ensuring her victory. Both the candidates belong to the Lingayat community, with Gaddigoudar belonging to the Ganiga sub-caste and Patil to the Panchamsali sub-caste. Gaddigoudar is banking on his non-controversial and friendly image and the fact that Patil does not belong to Bagalkot to boost his chances of re-election. Samyukta Patil, on the other hand, is focusing on the successful implementation of the Congress' five guarantees.\n\nKarnataka BJP president B.Y. Vijayendra pays tribute to Neha Hiremath, a student who was stabbed to death by a classmate, in Hubballi on April 23. The murder has become a major political rallying point in the run-up to the election. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nBijapur: The contest in this reserved constituency (SC) is between Ramesh Jigajinagi, a veteran parliamentarian from the BJP, and a Hanumant (Raju) Alagur of the Congress, a former MLA. Jigajinagi is a six-time parliamentarian who belongs to the left-hand agglomeration of Dalits in Karnataka. The Congress, which picked Lambani (considered a touchable Dalit caste) candidates in the past, has changed its strategy this time around. Alagur served as an MLA for two terms and belongs to the right-hand agglomeration of Dalits in Karnataka. The JD (S) has a limited base here but that has eroded after its alliance with the BJP. Lingayats and Dalits are the two largest communities but there are also significant numbers of Muslims and Kurubas.\n\nAlso Read | In Karnataka, it's a battle of 'guarantees'\n\nKalaburagi: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had never lost an election throughout his long political career spanning over five decades until 2019, when Umesh Jadhav of the BJP defeated him in this reserved (SC) constituency by a margin of almost 1 lakh votes. Jadhav has been renominated from the BJP while the Congress has nominated Radhakrishna Doddamani, a choice that surprised many, but the fact that he is Kharge's son-in-law has ensured that any opposition to his candidature has been subdued. Six of the eight MLAs from the constituency are with the Congress, while the BJP and JD (S) have one MLA each. Apart from Dalits. Lingayats and Muslims constitute an important component of the electorate.\n\nRaichur: The contest in this reserved constituency (ST) is interesting because of a quirky coincidence. The Congress' candidate is former civil servant G. Kumar Naik, who was the Deputy Commissioner of Raichur district between 1999 and 2002. His opponent, Raja Amareshwar Naik, the scion of a minor local royal family, was a Minister and district in-charge of Raichur during Kumar Naik's tenure. Thus, the two candidates who worked together while administering the district are now competing against each other. In the Assembly election of 2023, the Congress won five seats while the BJP won two and the JD (S) one. Apart from Valmikis, Dalits, Muslims, Kurubas, and Lingayats are the significant communities in this constituency.\n\nBidar: A political greenhorn from the Congress, 26-year-old Sagar Khandre, who is a third-generation politician, will take on Union Minister Bhagwant Khuba, a Union Minister, who is aiming for a hat-trick victory from this constituency. While Sagar is the candidate, Khuba's real fight is with his father, Eshwar Khandre, Forest and Environment Minister, who is investing all his resources and energy to ensure his son's victory. This is one of the few Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka where the BJP has more MLAs than the Congress. While the BJP emerged victorious in eight Assembly seats in last year's Assembly election, the Congress was able to win in three. Apart from Lingayats. who form the largest chunk of the electorate, Dalits, tribal people, and Muslims are present in significant numbers.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge with party leaders during a public meeting for the Lok Sabha election, in North Kalaburagi on May 4. | Photo Credit: ANI\n\nKoppal: The constituency has been electing candidates from the BJP over the past three Lok Sabha elections but the party suffered a setback after its two-term MP, Karadi Sanganna Amarappa, joined the Congress after he was denied a ticket and the BJP chose Dr Basavaraj Kyavater as its candidate. An orthopaedic, Dr Kyavater is a Lingayat, while his Congress opponent, Rajashekar Hitnal, is a Kuruba. Hitnal contested the 2019 election as well while his father, Basavaraj Hitnal, contested and lost in 2014 against Amarappa. Rajashekar Hitnal is hoping to finally avenge the two defeats that he and his father suffered at the hands of the BJP and is also banking on the consolidation of the votes of backward communities, Muslims, Dalits, and tribal voters.\n\nBellary: In this reserved seat (ST), the BJP's B. Sriramulu will face the Congress' E. Tukaram. Sriramulu became infamous during the iron ore mining scandal that rocked Karnataka in the 2000s because of his intimate relationship with the Reddy brothers but has since transcended the stigma of that association to emerge as a leader of the Valmiki community. Sriramulu's significant political stints as Minister and the entry of Janardhan Reddy's party into the BJP fold has also increased his support base. Tukaram is also a Valmiki and has a clean image in this constituency where both parties have an entrenched support base.\n\nHaveri: This is the first time that a former Chief Minister will be contesting from this constituency in central Karnataka. Basavaraj Bommai of the BJP, who helmed the State from 2021 to 2023, is pitted against a young Congress candidate, Anandaswamy Gaddadevaramath. Both the candidates belong to the Lingayat community. Bommai is focusing on his achievements during his tenure as Chief Minister, while Gaddadevaramath is banking on the solid gains that the Congress made in this constituency's Assembly segments in last year's election, when it won seven of the eight seats. Apart from Lingayats. who form the overwhelming majority, there are large numbers of Dalits, tribal people, and Muslims in the constituency.\n\nDharwad: The BJP's candidate, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, a Brahmin, is hoping for his fifth consecutive victory from this constituency. A young Congress leader, Vinod Asuti, who belong to the backward Kuruba caste, is the challenger. A Lingayat pontiff Fakir Dingaleshwar had filed his nomination papers intending to contest as an independent candidate as he was miffed with the BJP's choice of a Brahmin candidate in this constituency where Lingayats form an overwhelming majority, but he later withdrew his candidature, vowing to ensure the defeat of Joshi. This decision may help consolidate votes in favour of the Congress although the BJP is focusing on the murder of Neha Hiremath, who was a resident of Hubballi which forms part of this constituency, and casting the crime as a larger conspiracy of 'love jehad'.\n\nUttara Kannada: This coastal constituency is considered a safe seat for the BJP as former Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde has won it on six occasions since 1996. Hegde was considered a frontrunner this time as well but was replaced by former Karnataka Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, after the former's controversial remarks suggesting that the Constitution would be changed if the BJP won more than 400 seats. As this constituency incorporates parts of Belagavi district, where the BJP surges ahead, the Congress picked former MLA Dr Anjali Nimbalkar, who is from Khanapur. as its candidate. The demographic breakup of the constituency is also unique in Karnataka as religious minorities (Muslims and Christians) form the single largest chunk of the voters. There are also significant numbers of Marathas, Dalits, and tribal and Namdhari voters.\n\nGovernment officials on poll duty with equipment allotted to them before moving to their polling booths, in Haveri on May 6. | Photo Credit: Sajay Ritti\n\nDavanagere: This is the only constituency where both the main contenders are women and notably, one of the few constituencies in Karnataka where women voters outnumber men. A Lingayat stronghold of central Karnataka, Davanagere has long been the fiefdom of two families: that of Shamanur Shivashankarappa of the Congress and G.N. Mallikarjunappa of the BJP. The two contestants in the fray now are the daughters-in-law of these patriarchs and thus, the current electoral contest of Davanagere is being seen as a continuation of the battle between these two families. A rebel Congress candidate, G.B. Vinay Kumar, is also in the fray in this constituency where Lingayats, tribal people, Dalits, and Muslims are present in large numbers. Of the eight MLAs from this seat, seven are with the Congress while the BJP has only one MLA.\n\nShivamogga: The entry of BJP rebel candidate K.S. Eshwarappa in what was slated to be a direct and prestigious fight between the children of two former Chief ministers from the BJP and Congress has ensured that Shivamogga has been in the limelight for the past few months. B.Y. Raghavendra, son of former Cheif Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who has represented this constituency thrice, is known for maintaining a low profile and is banking on Lingayat support and avid Hindutva adherents to see him through. His challenger is Geeta Shivarajkumar, who has multiple and illustrious antecedents: she is the daughter of former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa, the daughter-in-law of Kannada film legend Dr Rajkumar and wife of Kannada cinema's reigning star, Shivarajkumar. She is also the and sister of Minister Madhu Bangarappa. She hopes that the large number of Idiga and Muslim voters in the constituency will see her through.\n\nSumming up, the 14 Lok Sabha constituencies of north Karnataka represent the larger political battle being waged across the State. With high-profile candidates (many of whom are political dynasts), intense family rivalries, and crucial caste equations at play, the region promises a thrilling electoral contest between the BJP and the Congress. The performance of these two national parties in this belt will significantly influence the Lok Sabha results. As voters head to the booths on May 7, all eyes will be on whether the BJP can repeat its sweep of 2019 or if the Congress can regain its traditional strongholds through its successful implementation of the give guarantees."""

253,253,"b'For over a week now, there\'s been a flurry of high-profile visits to a two-storeyed house in the Bidnal neighbourhood at the entrance to Hubballi city in Karnataka. On the narrow lane outside the house is a shamiana where a handful of TV crew and reporters wait as one political leader after another drops in to offer condolences to the family of 22-year-old college student Neha Hiremath, whose murder -- captured in gruesome detail on camera -- has shocked people and is roiling the poll cauldron in the region with its virality.\n\nNeha, a BCA student at the B.V. Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering and Technology near Hubballi\'s city centre, was stabbed multiple times allegedly by her former classmate Fayaz Khondunaik on the college campus on April 18. Based on the initial reaction of her father, Niranjan Hiremath, a Congress councillor, who blamed the local police for delay in filing an FIR and not acting swiftly on his complaint of a \'conspiracy\' in the murder, the BJP accused the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government of appeasement and claimed there was a \'love-jihad\' angle to the murder.\n\nFollowing this, several demonstrations condemning the murder and seeking exemplary punishment for Khondunaik -- who was arrested soon after the crime -- were taken out in Hubballi and elsewhere in northern Karnataka towns. Muslim associations in Hubballi too organised a day\'s strike during which businesses downed shutters in solidarity with the family, and put up posters captioned Justice for Neha. Separately, speaking to reporters, Khondunaik\'s mother apologised to Neha\'s family and sought strict punishment for her son. While she said the two had been in a relationship for some time, Neha\'s family has denied the claim.\n\nHubballi city, which falls under Dharwad Lok Sabha constituency, is a BJP bastion represented by Union minister Pralhad Joshi for four terms. Joshi is seeking a fifth term on the back of the Narendra Modi government\'s 10-year track record and his own achievements, such as setting up a National Forensic Sciences University campus in Dharwad district in addition to the Indian Institute of Technology and Indian Institute of Information Technology also in Dharwad, and reducing travel time by train to Bengaluru through line-doubling and electrification.\n\nBut this time around, there had been a curious build-up to the race in Dharwad, with the Dingaleshwara Swamiji, a seer from a religious matha at Balehosur, filing a nomination to contest against Joshi, whom he has accused of neglecting the Lingayats. While Joshi is a Brahmin, Dharwad has a sizeable population of Lingayats, and the entry of the seer into the poll race has threatened to queer the pitch. Meanwhile, the Congress, which has in the past put up Lingayat candidates, this time experimented with a new face -- Vinod Asooti, 34, from the Kuruba community.\n\nHowever, the seer withdrew his nomination at the last moment on April 22, thereby leaving the field open for a straight fight between the BJP and the Congress. Dharwad votes on May 7. The Dingaleshwara Swamiji told reporters that he reconsidered his decision on the advice of the senior pontiff. But, repeating the accusations, the seer said he would continue his \'dharma yuddha\' against Joshi.\n\nAccording to a Lingayat community leader, the seer\'s decision may have also been a fallout of the outcry stemming from the murder of Neha, who belonged to the community. The swamiji is associated with the Shirahatti Fakkireshwar matha, whose origins trace back to about four centuries ago to the reign of the Adil Shahi dynasty in the Deccan, and which follows a tradition of communal harmony with both Hindus and Muslims worshipping there.\n\nThe murder also put the Congress government on the backfoot -- it quickly transferred the case to the criminal investigation department and set up a fast-track court to try the case. While BJP national president J.P. Nadda met Neha\'s family to offer condolences, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, ministers H.K. Patil and Laxmi Hebbalkar and Congress state-in-charge Randeep Surjewala too visited Niranjan to assure him of speedy justice.\n\n""This is an unfortunate incident. The case has been handed over to the CID and we will strive for the maximum punishment under law,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters on April 25 after meeting Neha\'s parents. ""The BJP is playing politics with this incident. I will not do that.""\n\nAsked about it, Pralhad Joshi countered: ""On the same day [of the murder], if they (government) had behaved with some sensitivity, the question would have not arisen."" Accusing the Congress of soft-peddling the issue, he claimed the remedial steps came only after \'society at large is showing their anger at what has happened to Neha\'. In his recent campaigns in Karnataka, Prime Minister Modi too has brought up the Neha murder while attacking the Congress government.\n\nOn May 1, Neha\'s parents met Union home minister Amit Shah, who was campaigning in Hubballi. According to reports, Niranjan submitted a memorandum to Shah, appealing for a law for stringent action in such crimes.'"

263,263,"b'Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said that 2024 elections are a historic one wherein people have to decide between a Prime Minister who can secure the country or those who will allow bomb blasts to happen for the sake of vote-bank politics.\n\nAddressing a mammoth election rally at Nehru Stadium in Hubballi for making a vote appeal for BJP candidate and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, Mr. Shah listed out the reasons for which the people should vote for making Narendra Modi Prime Minister for the third time.\n\nMr. Shah said that under Mr. Modi, the country has become more secure, as the Prime Minister had protected the country from terrorism.\n\nHe said that during the UPA government, terrorist attacks used to go unpunished while under Mr. Modi, befitting reply was given to Pakistan for terror acts.\n\nHe said that because of its vote-bank politics, the Congress took the help of the SDPI and when it came to power in Karnataka, a bomb blast occurred. He said that for vote-bank politics, the Congress has put safety and security of the country at stake.\n\nRaising the Ram Mandir issue, he said that Congress leaders did not even attend the installation of the idol of Lord Ram in Ayodhya for the fear of losing their vote-bank and sought to know from the people whether they can live with such people.\n\nHe said that under Modi, casteism and dynasty politics have been completely alleviated leading only to development politics.\n\nDrought politics\n\nMr. Shah accused the State government of doing drought politics and said that the delay in releasing drought relief amount to Karnataka was because of the delay by the State government in submitting memorandum due to infighting between Siddaramaiah and D.K. Shivakumar.\n\nThe Union Minister also said that during the UPA government between 2004 and 2014, only \xe2\x82\xb91.42 lakh crore was released to the State, whereas under Mr. Modi, \xe2\x82\xb94.98 lakh crore has been released in the last 10 years. This apart, the Centre has released funds for road development, airways and other works, he said.\n\nThe Union Home Minister said that he came to Hubballi only for the purpose of making a vote appeal for Mr. Joshi.\n\n""Don\'t commit any mistake. We have already given a Minister for Hubballi-Dharwad in the form of Mr. Joshi and if you re-elect him, Mr. Modi and I assure you he will get a higher position after his re-election,"" he said.\n\nBefore concluding his speech, Mr. Shah said that every vote given to Mr. Joshi will further strengthen Mr. Modi and make him Prime Minister for the third time, which, in turn, will help completely eradicate terrorism and naxal activities.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Joshi spoke about his achievements and how India has progressed under Mr. Modi. He listed out various initiatives of the Union government to make the country see progress.\n\nA host of leaders, including MLAs Basangaouda Patil Yatnal, Mahesh Tenginakai, M.R.

264,264,"b'Under a scorching sun and amidst a severe drought, 14 constituencies in northern and central Karnataka are going to the polls on May 7. Complaints about regional imbalances and unkept promises -- especially related to irrigation projects -- are an undercurrent, though constantly overshadowed by communal narratives and the blame game between parties in the last leg of the campaign.\n\nThe emergence of right-wing activism in the aftermath of the 1992 Idgah riots in Hubballi and the subsequent political realignment in the region, with members of the Janata Parivar shifting to the saffron party, has severely affected the Congress\' prospects in the region. The party\'s efforts to regain its glory have not yielded big results yet.\n\nIn the 2004, 2009, and 2014 elections, the Congress never got more than three seats out of the total 14 seats in northern and central Karnataka. Despite aligning with the Janata Dal (Secular) in 2019, the Congress was washed out in the region, with the BJP making a clean sweep. Under the changed political equations, the JD(S) has tied up with the BJP this time around, but is not contesting any seats in this region.\n\nThe BJP candidates in the 14 constituencies are clearly heavily dependent on Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s popularity and, in certain pockets, the Hindutva agenda. The Congress, on the other hand, is trying to minimise its effect by using its ""new guarantee card"" and highlighting the ""meagre drought relief"" for which it had to approach the Supreme Court.\n\nCentre releases disaster relief funds for Karnataka and Tamil Nadu New names, old issues\n\nNorth Karnataka was broadly categorised into Hyderabad Karnataka and Bombay (Mumbai) Karnataka, now renamed Kalyana Karnataka and Kittur Karnataka, respectively. The change in name has not changed the issues. For instance, out of 39 taluks across Karnataka identified as ""most backward"" by the D.M. Najundappa Committee report on regional imbalances, 26 are from north Karnataka. The situation in these taluks has not changed much. Important issues, such as the promise of making the Upper Krishna Project a national project, still remain a dream, and the much-debated Kalasa Banduri Nala project that aims to divert water from Mahadayi basin to the Malaprabha basin remains a non starter.\n\nHowever, these issues are not being debated much in the run up to the Lok Sabha election. A host of national and State-level leaders have addressed scores of rallies across this region, but very few have spoken about the debilitating drought and water scarcity that the region has been suffering from since the 2022 kharif season. Any debate on the lack of industries or other means of employment in north Karnataka, compared to the south, is also not to be heard.\n\nThe issues that are being raised instead, are the castes and sub castes of candidates, the murder of student Neha Hiremath on a college campus in Hubballi that has been used to set a communal narrative, and the Bengaluru cafe blast case, used to speak of wider threats to national security. Over the last few days, though the JD(S) is not a big force to reckon with in most parts of north Karnataka, the alleged sex scandal involving JD(S)leader Prajwal Revanna has somewhat shifted focus from the Neha Hiremath murder.\n\n\'Family election\'\n\nUnder pressure to make inroads in these constituencies which have remained with the BJP, the Congress has fielded many children and relatives of Ministers in this election. Ministers Satish Jarkiholi\'s daughter Priyanka Jarkiholi, Shivanand Patil\'s daughter Samyukta Patil, Ishwar Khandre\'s son Sagar Khandre, Laxmi Hebbalkar\'s son Mrinal Hebbalkar, and S.S. Mallikarjun\'s wife Prabha Mallikarjun are in the fray, and the Ministers are sweating it out to ensure their victory.\n\nCongress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has taken on the task of getting his son-in-law Radhakrishan Doddamani elected from his home constituency of Kalaburagi. Mr. Kharge\'s emotional appeal to voters to ""at least attend my funeral even if you do not vote for me"" is testimony to what a prestige battle this is for him. He often reminds people about the denial of special status to Kalyana Karnataka under Article 371 (J) by BJP leader and then-Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani in 1999, when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power at the Centre. The demand was only fulfilled by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government in 2012.\n\nTwo ex-Chief Ministers -- Jagadish Shettar and Basavaraj Bommai -- are contesting Lok Sabha elections for the first time on a BJP ticket. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi is striving for re-election and so are former Union Minister Ramesh Jigajinagi and MP P.C. Gaddigoudar. Former Union Minister G.M. Siddeshwar is going all out to ensure victory for his wife Gayatri. Another former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is under pressure to get his son B.Y. Raghavendra elected, amidst a rebellion by his one-time party colleague K.S. Eshwarappa.\n\nRebellion is affecting both the BJP and the Congress in a few of the 14 seats. The BJP\'s Anna Saheb Jolle in Chikkodi, Bhagawant Khuba in Bidar, and Jagadish Shettar in Belagavi are likely to be affected by the dissent within the party. In Belagavi, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti is also likely to take a section of Maratha votes away from the BJP. Having been denied a ticket this time around, Uttar Kannada\'s incumbent MP Ananthkumar Hegde has remained neutral, which may affect BJP\'s prospects. The Congress is also dealing with the rebel factor in the Davanagere and Bagalkot constituencies.\n\n(With inputs from Rishikesh Bahadur Desai & Kumar Buradikatti)\n\nRead Comments'"

266,266,"b""Rambhapuri Kalyanamantapa at Vidyangar in Hubballi witnessed high drama on Saturday after officials from Election Commission and police stopped a meeting of religious heads from various mutts headed by Fakira Dingaleshwar Swami resulting in many seers taking out a protest march condemning the action.\n\nFakira Dingaleshwar Swami, who is openly campaigning against Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, had convened a meeting at the marriage hall and had also sought permission from the requisite authorities for the same on Friday.\n\nHowever, when they began the meeting on Saturday, officials from the Election Commission of India entered the hall and sought to know whether they had received the permission letter to which the seers replied in the negative. Dingaleshwar Swami told the officials that although they had applied for permission, it had not been granted, nor had it been rejected. He said the officials had only delayed it.\n\nHowever, when the officials told them that they could not allow the meeting to happen without permission, the seers, upset with the development, decided to take out a protest march. From Vidyanagar, scores of seers led by Fakira Dingaleshwar Swami and others marched to Kittur Chennamma Circle and then to municipal corporation premises, where they staged a demonstration.\n\nOn the Municipal Corporation premises, there was discussion over the issue for almost half an hour and the seers insisted that the Municipal Commissioner should come to the spot to clarify why permission had not been given. They also demanded that the police inspector Dharegouda Patil, who reportedly said that he would be forced to arrest the seers if the meeting continued, should apologise for his words.\n\nUltimately, Municipal Commissioner Ishwar Ullagadi came to the spot to clarify that as in the application for permission it was mentioned as a political meeting, they had not given it since a religious place was at the same premises. He clarified that the officials had done their job and they would permit them to hold a non-political meeting.\n\nThe seers, who were not satisfied with the clarification, demanded an apology from the police inspector because of whom they were forced to stage a protest. However, after Deputy Commissioner of Police P. Rajiv said that he would apologise if the development had hurt them and requested them to hold a non-political meeting, the seers withdrew their protest.\n\nSpeaking to presspersons, Fakira Dingaleshwar Swami alleged that Mr. Joshi, who was afraid of the outcome of the seers' meeting had tried to stop them through the Election Commission. He alleged that there was 'divide and rule' like Britishers in Municipal Corporation also and that EC officials and police were acting at the behest of Mr. Joshi. He said that his 'holy war' against Mr. Joshi would continue to get him defeated in the election.\n\nSubsequently, the seers returned to the venue and held their meeting on socio-religious issues concerning the Veerashaiva Lingayat community. They passed various resolutions including protecting the community against those who try to suppress and work for spreading the message of Basavanna.\n\nRead Comments"""
267,267,"b'The BJP\'s Hindutva push is unlikely to have much impact amid a severe water shortage.\n\nFor the last few days, Janata Dal (Secular) leader Prajwal Revanna has featured prominently in the headlines. After the leak of video clips allegedly showing him forcing perhaps hundreds of women to perform sexual acts, the Member of Parliament has reportedly fled India. Revanna is seeking re-election from the southern Karnataka constituency of Hassan as an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nBut in Ankalga village, 50 km west of the district headquarters of Kalaburagi at the other end of the state, Revanna\'s alleged crimes were not among the key concerns of Shekhappa, Srimanth and Shivappa as their constituency and 13 others in Karnataka head to the polls on May 7, in the third phase of the elections. The state\'s 14 other constituencies had voted on April 26.\n\nSitting on a granite bench on the veranda of a shuttered shop as the temperature soared to a scorching 42 degrees celsius, the three farmers had other matters to worry about: relentless drought, a crippling water shortage and the devastating crop failures in their village.\n\nKalaburagi constituency, the home turf of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, is among the districts in the state that has been hit hardest by the drought.\n\nShekhappa said that due to the water crisis, they have not been able to grow crops. ""Our situation is dire,"" he said. ""How can we even consider elections when our very lives are threatened?""\n\nHe said that he and his friends would cast their votes for the party that their local leaders instructed them to - though he would not say who exactly these leaders were. ""They provide us with money, which sustains us for a short while,"" he explained.\n\nThe situation is no different in Channagiri in the central Karnataka district of Davanagere, 400 km south of Kalburgi.\n\nThe water shortage has dealt a severe blow to herder BK Channappa\'s flock of sheep. ""This has been a persistent issue for years, yet the politicians have failed to address it,"" said the 60-year-old as he guided his hundred or so animals back to his home in Rajagondanahalli.\n\nTo register his protest, Channappa was thinking of boycotting the election. ""Why should I participate in electing someone who won\'t bring any benefit to us?"" he asked.\n\nIn Pandamotti village in the Davanagere constituency, coconut farmer AG Ankalappa shells out Rs 6,000 to buy 35,000 litres of water every week. ""Without watering my trees, my survival is at stake,"" he said. ""Despite farmers repeatedly highlighting this concern to politicians, no concrete steps have been taken.""\n\nDrought looms large as a crucial election concern across most of North Karnataka. Though the Union government on April 26 released Rs 3,454 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund to help relieve the drought, the amount forms a mere 20% of the Rs 18,174 crore requested by Karnataka.\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the amount was ""woefully inadequate"".\n\nPriyank Kharge, Karnataka\'s Minister for Information Technology, Biotechnology, and Rural Development, who is heading the Congress campaign in Kalaburagi, believes that voters will respond to what he says is the Bharatiya Janata Party\'s lack of support for the state in this time of crisis.\n\n""The BJP takes votes and notes [taxes] from Kannadigas, but gives nothing in return,"" he declared. ""The BJP government at the Centre was forced to release a paltry amount only after the state government approached the Supreme Court. It is a shame.""\n\nBJP officials denied the accusation. They said that the Central government had to get special permission from the Election Commission to release the funds. ""This action was taken despite the presence of the Election Code of Conduct and its associated restrictions,"" said state party chief BY Vijayendra.\n\nIn Davanagere, Congress contender Prabha Mallikarjun endorsed Kharge\'s sentiments. ""Drought remains a significant concern in this region and it can be resolved only if Karnataka receives its rightful share from the Central government,"" she said.\n\nBut her BJP rival Gayatri Siddeshwara insisted that the current MP, her husband GM Siddeshwara, has taken concrete steps to address the water crisis. ""He has spearheaded numerous lake rejuvenation initiatives, with the support of both the Central and state governments,"" she said. ""My victory will ensure that these crucial projects continue.""\n\nIn the electoral landscape of Karnataka, Davanagere stands out as the sole constituency where both the Congress and the BJP have nominated female candidates.\n\nPrabha Mallikarjun is the wife of SS Mallikarjun, Karnataka\'s Minister for Mines and Geology and Horticulture, and the daughter-in-law of veteran Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa.\n\nBoth candidates are members of the dominant Lingayat community. Their nominations have sparked discussions about dynasty politics. But Prabha Mallikarjun rebutted this suggestion. She claimed that she was given the ticket on her own merit because the Congress allocated her a vital task.\n\n""This constituency is considered a stronghold for the BJP and the Congress aims to claim it,"" she said. ""Hence, my party has entrusted me with the task of winning it."" She added: ""The party must have considered my social activities for the last 26 years before giving me the ticket.""\n\nGayatri Siddeshwara argues that her candidacy does not reflect dynastic politics since only one member of her family is involved in politics at any given time. ""My husband is not running in this election, which is why I received the ticket,"" she explained. ""The Congress has nominated the wife of a minister for this seat. That, to me, is dynastic politics, not ours. BJP always opposes dynasty politics.""\n\nSimilar discussions about dynastic politics echoed in Belagavi, 250 km north of Davanagere. Here, veteran BJP leader and former chief minister Jagadish Shettar is pitted against the Congress\'s Mrinal Hebbalkar. Both contenders are from the Lingayat community, but Shettar is affiliated with the Banajige sect while Hebbalkar represents the numerically stronger Panchamasali sect.\n\nShettar replaced incumbent Mangala Angadi, but the ticket remained within the family: Shettar\'s son is married to Angadi\'s daughter.\n\nCongress candidate Mrinal Hebbalkar, meanwhile, is the son of Karnataka Minister for Women and Child Development Lakshmi Hebbalkar.\n\nSeveral voters were dismayed by the choice they have been presented. ""BJP leader Suresh Angadi represented us four times from 2004 to 2019,"" said shop owner Avinash Patil in Belagavi town. ""After his death, his wife Mangala won the by-election in 2021. Now, their relative Shettar is in the fray. Congress has fielded Minister Hebbalkar\'s son Mrinal. Whoever wins, it is beneficial for the families.""\n\nThe BJP faces a significant challenge in Belagavi as the scrappy Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti has nominated Mahadev Patil as its candidate. Established in 1951, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti advocates for the merger of all Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka with Maharashtra.\n\nIn a Lok Sabha bye-election in Belagavi in 2021, the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti candidate won over one lakh votes, accounting for 11.5% of the total votes cast. This cut the BJP\'s victory margin from 3.91 lakh votes in 2019 to a mere 5,240 two years later.\n\nMaharashtra Ekikaran Samiti leader advocate Amar Yallurkar said that the party\'s aims were simple: ""The election is an opportune moment to demonstrate our influence,"" he said.\n\nIf there is one seat in Karnataka that Congress cannot afford to lose, it is Kalaburagi, the home of the party\'s national president and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge.\n\nThe 81-year-old veteran won 11 consecutive elections - nine to the state assembly from Gurmitkal constituency in Kalaburagi and two to the Lok Sabha from Kalaburagi - before suffering his first defeat in this constituency in 2019. He was beaten by former follower-turned-rival Umesh Jadhav of the BJP by over 95,000 votes.\n\nThe task of regaining the seat has been entrusted to Kharge\'s son-in-law, businessman Radhakrishna Doddamani.\n\nThe BJP had indicated its determination to secure the seat when Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew down from New Delhi to launch his election campaign in Kalaburagi on March 16, a few hours before the Election Commission announced the seven-phase general election schedule.\n\nThe Congress has been emphasising Kharge\'s efforts in implementing Article 371 (J) of the Constitution, which grants special status to the backward Kalyana-Karnataka region, and ensuring quotas for residents in education and employment in the state. The Congress claims that the BJP government at the Centre had turned down Karnataka government\'s proposal for the special status in 2002.\n\nKalyana Karnataka, formerly known as Hyderabad Karnataka, comprises seven backward districts - Kalaburagi, Bidar, Yadgir, Raichur, Koppal, Bellari and Vijayanagara.\n\nJadhav, on the other hand, is banking on the ""Modi guarantees"" of welfare that the BJP has been advertising and the Hindutva agenda to bolster his campaign.\n\nPriyank Kharge claimed that a Congress triumph is assured this time around because voters want to make amends to their choice in 2019. ""People have realised that the BJP\'s Hindutva politics does not offer a path forward,"" he said. ""What they seek now is a leader committed to driving development.""\n\nBJP spokesperson Baburao Hagaragundagi claimed that the Congress\'s attempt to ""use the Article 317 (J) card"" will not resonate with voters. ""It is all about Hindutva and Modiji,"" he claimed.\n\nThough the allegations of rape against Prajwal Revanna have provided the Congress with potent ammunition to target the BJP, the matter seems to have little influence in the North Karnataka region.\n\nThe presence of the Janata Dal (Secular) in the North Karnataka districts is also abysmally low.\n\nOn May 2, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prajwal Revanna had assaulted over 400 women and demanded an apology from Modi for endorsing the campaign of a ""mass rapist"".\n\nThe BJP has disavowed Prajwal Revanna, with Home Minister Amit Shah personally advocating the harshest punishment for him. Shah said that the BJP cannot endorse individuals who commit crimes against women. He was speaking at an election rally in Hubballi on May 1, where Union Minister Pralhad Joshi is vying for re-election for the fifth time against the relatively inexperienced Vinod Asooti from the Congress.\n\nThe BJP has instead seized upon the murder of 23-year-old college student Neha Hiremath in Hubballi. Hiremath, a second-year college student and the daughter of a Congress corporator, was stabbed to death in the college campus by her former classmate Fayaz Khondunaik. Khondunaik has been apprehended and is in judicial custody.\n\nThe BJP claimed that this was yet another instance of ""love jihad"" - a conspiracy theory by Hindutva organisations suggesting that Muslim men court Hindu women merely to convert them to Islam.\n\nHoardings featuring the Hiremath\'s photo with the slogan ""Justice for Neha"" have been put up by Hindutva organisations on every lamp post at the entrance of Hubballi city.\n\nBasavanthappa Soppi, a farmer leader in Hubballi, said the BJP\'s attempt to communalise the murder was deplorable. ""Pralhad Joshi, seeking his fifth term from Hubballi, has failed to address the pressing needs of the people and farmers in Hubballi,"" he said. ""The constituency grapples with water scarcity, yet Joshi has consistently overlooked this issue.""\n\nSoppi criticised Joshi\'s exploitation of the murder for political gain, drawing parallels with the BJP\'s weaponisation of the controversy over the Idgah Maidan in Hubballi back in 1992.\n\nThe Idgah Maidan movement of 1992 resulted in Hindutva activists attempting to hoist the national flag on a ground used for Muslim prayers in Hubballi town. Often referred to as the ""Ayodhya of the South"", the incident culminated in violence that left six dead in 1994 and bolstered the BJP\'s presence in Karnataka.\n\nPriyank Kharge asked why Modi remains silent in the face of allegations against his coalition partner Prajwal Revanna. ""If he genuinely cares about women\'s issues, he should condemn Prajwal Revanna. His silence exposes his double standards,"" Kharge said.\n\nKamalaxi G Tadasa, a political analyst and professor of political science at Rani Channamma University, Belagavi, said that the rape and murder are unlikely to sway a significant portion of voters in North Karnataka.\n\n""Concerns about drought, water scarcity and agricultural distress are paramount for people in this region,"" she said. ""While these issues may have gained national attention, their impact on the elections in North Karnataka is likely to be minimal.""'"

Deve Gowda, ahead of the third phase of Lok Sabha polls to be held on May 7.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the JD-S suspended Prajwal Revanna, the sitting party MP and Lok Sabha candidate from Hassan, after the Congress government in Karnataka formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe allegations of sexual abuse against him.\n\nSpeaking to the media in Hubballi, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi questioned the state government for not lodging an FIR against Prajwal Revanna immediately after the alleged scandal came to light.\n\n""People are saying there is an internal adjustment between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and H.D. Reavanna (JD-S MLA and father of Prajwal Reavanna). The Congress is resorting to levelling allegations with utter irresponsibility,"" he said.\n\n""The police should have filed the FIR immediately...

The scandal needs to be condemned by all. A complaint has been lodged against Prajwal Revanna, who\'s an NDA candidate, and there should be an impartial probe against him. The victims must be protected by the state women\'s commission,"" he stated.\n\n""After coming to know about the case, the Deve Gowda family tried to hush up the matter.

""Don\'t vote for Basavaraj Bommai and Pralhad Joshi for any reason. They (BJP) have hyped and used the Neha Hiremath case for political gain only.

300,300,"b'BARPETA/THIRUVANANTHPURAM, India, May 7 (Reuters) - As India votes in a six-week general election, Narendra Modi\'s image adorns everything from packs of rice handed out to the poor to large posters in cities and towns.\n\nHis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is relying on the prime minister\'s popularity as it seeks a super-majority in India\'s parliament. Its message: Modi has delivered economic growth, infrastructure upgrades and India\'s improved standing in the world.\n\nBut as the Hindu nationalist party and its allies target 400 of the 543 seats in India\'s lower house of parliament - up from 352 won in 2019 - they are also employing local tactics in some vital constituencies they hope to wrest from the opposition. Opinion polls indicate Modi will win a rare third term when voting ends on June 1. But only once in Indian history has a party crossed the 400 mark - when the centre-left Congress party romped to victory following the assassination of its leader Indira Gandhi in 1984.\n\nTo examine how the right-wing National Democratic Alliance (NDA) aims to achieve that feat - and the obstacles it faces - Reuters spoke to nine NDA officials, three opposition leaders and two political analysts, as well as voters in six opposition-held seats the alliance is targeting.\n\nThey identified three of the BJP\'s key tactics: enlisting celebrity candidates to unseat veteran opposition lawmakers; making an assault on the opposition\'s southern strongholds by appealing to minorities such as Christians; and exploiting redrawn political boundaries that bolster the Hindu electorate in some opposition-controlled areas in the north.\n\n""A combination of strategies, organisational commitment and tactical flexibility will help make inroads in seats never held by the party ever before,"" BJP President J. P. Nadda, who oversees the party\'s election strategy, told Reuters in April. Some critics have warned the BJP would use a large majority to push through a more radical agenda in a third term. While the BJP\'s manifesto focuses heavily on economic growth, it has also pledged to scrap separate legal codes for religious and tribal groups in areas such as marriage and inheritance. Many Muslims and tribal groups oppose the plan, which would require a constitutional amendment to be passed by at least two-thirds of parliament.\n\n""Modi wants a landslide majority only to be able to end the debate and deliberation on any policy matter in the parliament,"" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge told Reuters. Following low turnout in early voting, some BJP campaign officials have in recent days appeared less confident of securing a huge majority, though the party still expects to form the next government.\n\nSOUTHERN STRATEGY Modi\'s party has criticised the dynastic politics that it says afflicts Congress, long dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi family. But in Pathanamthitta, a seat in the southern state of Kerala, it is fielding a political scion in Anil Antony - son of a veteran Congress leader.\n\nThe constituency, home to a sizeable Christian minority, has been held by Congress since its creation in 2009.\n\nAnil\'s father, former defense minister A.K. Antony, supports the incumbent and has denounced his son, a fellow Christian, for representing the Hindu nationalist party.\n\nBut Anil has another supporter: Modi, who came to Pathanamthitta in March and praised the BJP candidate for his ""fresh vision and leadership"". The prime minister has visited the five states of southern India at least 16 times since December.\n\nNadda, the BJP president, acknowledged that winning a supermajority would require performing well in the five southern states, which are home to about 20% of India\'s population but have not traditionally voted for his party.\n\nIn 2019, the NDA won just 31 of 130 seats across Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, all of which are linguistically diverse and have many Muslim and Christian voters.\n\nJiji Joseph, general secretary of the BJP\'s minority wing in Kerala, said the party has made a concerted push for the 18% of voters there who are Christians. The BJP did not win a single seat in Kerala at the last general election.\n\n""The BJP launched active contact with the Church and we started interacting with clergies directly,"" he said, adding that the party now has 11,000 active Christian members. ""There is a change. Christians now want to believe that BJP stands for them.""\n\nIn April, Anil became the first BJP candidate in Kerala to be endorsed by Christian leaders. He told Reuters his selection indicated the party offered opportunities to members from minority groups. He declined to comment on relations with his father. Jayant Joseph, a Keralan Christian voter, said he backed the BJP because he had read media reports about Muslim men marrying Christian women and converting them to Islam. Most moderate Hindus consider allegations of large-scale forced conversions to be a conspiracy theory.\n\n""Kerala is a secular state,"" he said. ""But for it to continue to be a secular state, the Muslim population and their conversion strategy must be kept under check.""\n\nA Modi political aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to media, said the NDA expects to win about 50 seats in the south.\n\nK. Anil Kumar, a senior leader of Kerala\'s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), said he did not believe BJP would do well in his state, which he said has a strong tradition of secularism. ""The BJP might try to side with the Christians on some issues but they are fundamentally a party of the Hindus and for the Hindus,"" he said.\n\nSTAR CANDIDATES\n\nIn the Mandi constituency of the northern state of Himachal Pradhesh, the BJP has recruited Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut to break the Congress party\'s grip on power. Congress is fielding as its candidate Vikramaditya Singh, whose mother currently represents the constituency. His father was the state\'s long-time chief minister.\n\nRanaut, a political novice who calls herself a ""glorious right-wing"" personality, has starred in popular movies with nationalistic themes. She is known for her criticism of Bollywood executives who she said favoured the relatives of famous actors for opportunities. The actress is one of five actors running for the BJP this year, up from four in 2019.\n\nNo opinion polling on the Mandi race is publicly available.\n\nAnjana Negia, an elementary school teacher who plans to vote for Ranaut, acknowledged that her preferred candidate had no political experience. But she said that she valued a new face and that a Modi-backed candidate would help ""bring a fresh wave of development.""\n\nFielding celebrities and seeking the endorsement of entertainment personalities is relatively new for the BJP, which ""long resisted such tactics because of its cadre-based nature"" that prized grassroots efforts, said Milan Vaishnav, an expert on South Asian politics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.\n\nRanaut declined an interview request. Federal BJP spokesman Shahzad Poonawala said she ""has been successful in exposing dynastic culture and nepotism in Bollywood and now she is doing the same in politics.""\n\nSingh, a state minister responsible for urban development, told Reuters that his family\'s experiences gave him a better understanding of politics. Charges of nepotism were ""shallow"", he said.\n\nREDISTRICTING BENEFITS\n\nThe NDA is hoping for gains in the northeastern state of Assam, where it won nine of 14 seats in 2019. Assam\'s BJP chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said in March he was confident of winning 13 seats.\n\nThe NDA\'s confidence is rooted in a 2023 redistricting exercise in the state. India\'s non-partisan Election Commission routinely redraws seat boundaries to reflect population changes; it is tasked with ensuring that no political party gains undue advantage from the changes.\n\nBut exercises since the last federal election in Assam and far-northern Jammu and Kashmir, India\'s only majority Muslim region, diluted the Muslim vote in seats that the NDA is targeting, according to three BJP and four opposition officials.\n\nThe Election Commission declined to comment on the two exercises, citing the ongoing election.\n\nIn Assam, the NDA has high hopes for Congress-held Barpeta, which alliance candidate Phani Bhushan Choudhury said newly includes dozens of villages and some towns with large Hindu populations.\n\n""Earlier (Barpeta) had a Muslim majority but now it is a Hindu majority,"" said Choudhury. ""That change has worked in my favour."" He estimates that there are now 1.2 million Hindu voters in Barpeta, where he is campaigning on development and protecting the rights of what the NDA calls ""indigenous Assamese"" voters, who are mostly Hindu.\n\nChoudhury\'s Congress opponent Deep Bayan said the percentage of Hindus in Barpeta went from 30% to 70%. ""Instead focusing on real issues affecting the people...(the BJP does) the politics of polarisation,"" he said.\n\nThree of Jammu and Kashmir\'s five seats are majority Muslim and held by the opposition. But the NDA hopes to swing one of them, Anantnag-Rajouri, after its voter rolls swelled by more than 50% to over 2 million, according to government data.\n\nMany of the new voters are Hindus or from regional tribes - which benefited from new BJP policies awarding them education and employment privileges - according to regional BJP chief Ravinder Raina.\n\nRaina said the BJP would support an NDA partner that it believed could win Anantnag-Rajouri and focus on retaining the two Hindu-majority seats it holds.\n\nThe two redistricting exercises presages a broader remapping of constituencies due after the election.\n\nVaishnav, of the Carnegie Endowment, said the remapping would distribute seats to the BJP-dominated north, which has much higher population growth rates, to the detriment of wealthier south India.

It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'"

Questioning the connection between Rahul Gandhi and Pakistan, the UP CM said, ""Although Rahul Gandhi seeks votes from Raebareli, he receives support from Pakistan.""\n\nSpeaking at the rally PM Narendra Modi also lashed out at the SP saying that UP was at the top of crime when they were in charge of the state.\n\n""UP used to be on top in crime during the SP government. But in terms of development, UP was counted as a backward state. But today the BJP government has brought Uttar Pradesh to the top in development. Today Uttar Pradesh is at the top among the states with the maximum number of expressways. Uttar Pradesh is on top in terms of maximum number of airports. UP is on top by starting metro in 7 cities.

However, due to opposition from the NDA and BJP, the Congress\' plans couldn\'t be fulfilled, he added.\n\nThe chief minister accused the Congress of implementing Section 370 in Kashmir and undermining OBC reservation in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n""The people of India will never allow the intention of the Congress to be fulfilled because divisive politics is not in anyone\'s interest,"" he added.\n\nAdityanath emphasized the Congress\' manifesto is of divisive nature, warning that it could lead India towards class conflicts and encroach upon the rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes.\n\nHe, however, expressed confidence the people of the nation will resist these plans of the Congress.'"

Census is conducted after every 10 years. According to this, the census should have been conducted in 2021. Why did you delay the census for three years? Why did you stop Dalit and tribal communities from getting information about their population?"" Ramesh asked\n\nHe said, ""The second question is does the prime minister want an up-to-date socio-economic census or not? Why have you not broken your silence on this topic yet?""\n\n""In 2011, the Manmohan Singh government undertook a socio-economic and caste census. Why have you not released the information on caste yet?"" the Congress leader asked.\n\nThe Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) was conducted for the 2011 Census of India. The Manmohan Singh government had approved the Socio-Economic and Caste Census 2011 to be carried out after discussion in both houses of Parliament in 2010.\n\nIt was the first caste-based census since the 1931 Census of India.\n\nRamesh also sought to know the prime minister\'s views on the 50 per cent cap on reservation.\n\n""The third question is the 50 per cent cap on reservation for SC, ST and backward classes imposed by the Supreme Court. Would the prime minister remove it? Why is the prime minister running away from the census? Why is he scared?"" he said.\n\nRamesh claimed that PM Modi was going to ""leave the post"" soon, and the ""Congress government will do it"".\n\nAt a rally in Maharashtra\'s Nandurbar on Friday, Modi said he has grown up in poverty, and he knows the struggles of the marginalised communities. He said service to Adivasis and the deprived sections is like serving family members for him, adding that he is not like ""Congress\' \'shahi parivar\'"".\n\nThe prime minister said that he would be the \'chowkidar\' (guard) for the rights of the marginalised communities.'"

The voting for the fifth phase of 18th Lok Sabha elections will be held on May 20, which will cover 49 seats across 6 states and two Union Territories (UT). Of the 49 Lok Sabha seats, 14 are from Uttar Pradesh, 13 from Maharashtra, 7 from West Bengal, 5 from Bihar, 3 from Jharkhand, 5 from Odisha and one each from Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nThe fifth phase will witness key contests in various constituencies. Union Ministers including Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani and Piyush Goyal to opposition leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, JKNC chief Omar Abdullah, and RJD leader Rohini Acharya will be looking for electoral success.\n\nOut of the total 695 candidates in the fifth phase on May 20, only 82 of them are women, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) said. Out of total candidates that will contest in phase five, 18 per cent (122 candidates) have serious criminal cases pending, including that of murder, attempt to murder, crimes against women, and hate speech. Three candidates have declared convictions against them.\n\nKey candidates and constituencies in Phase 5 polls:\n\nRahul Randhi (Raebareli)\n\nRahul Gandhi, who also contested the 2024 Lok Sabha polls from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, is facing Congress defector and three-time MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh of the BJP in Raebareli. Meanwhile, former Congress chief has stepped down from contesting for Amethi, which he represented from 2004 until 2019.\n\nCongress leader and AICC President Sonia Gandhi who is now a member of Rajya Sabha appealed to the voters of Raebareli, asking them to accept his son Rahul Gandhi just like they accepted her, while assuring that ""he won\'t disappoint them"". Sonia Gandhi held the seat for four consecutive terms since 2004, before she took the Rajya Sabha route to the Parliament this year.\n\nSmriti Irani vs Kishori Lal Sharma (Amethi)\n\nThe contest for Amethi seat will be intense battle between Congress loyalist Kishori Lal Sharma and Union Minister Smriti Irin Amethi. The absence of a Gandhi family member here was expected to bring down the interest of voters, giving a walkover to Irani. But Congress workers say after initial hiccups, and with Priyanka Gandhi\'s relentless campaigning here since May 6, projecting the party candidate as family and a humble worker, he is increasingly in the reckoning. Irani had won the seat by 55,000 votes last time.\n\nKishori Lal Sharma, a close associate and loyalist of the Gandhi family, is originally from Punjab\'s Ludhiana. He has been working for the Congress Party in Amethi for years. BJP candidate Smriti Irani said that people in the constituency have understood that development is possible when the leader has good character and the government has clarity in its policies.\n\nThe Amethi seat has been represented by Rahul since 2004, and he remained a member of Parliament from the constituency until 2019. His father and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, too, was an elected member of Amethi in the Lower House from 1981 till his death in 1991. Sonia Gandhi contested elections from there in 1999 before passing the baton on to Rahul in 2004.\n\nRajnath Singh (Lucknow)\n\nHoping for a hatrick, Defence Minister and BJP candidate Rajnath Singh will face Samajwadi Party candidate Ravidas Mehrotra in this seat. Back in 2019, Rajnath Singh had defeated Samajwadi Party Poonam Shatrughan Sinha with over 6.3 lakh votes. He had defeated Congress candidate Rita Bahuguna Joshi by a margin of 2,72,749 votes in 2014.\n\nPiyush Goyal (Mumbai North)\n\nContesting for the first time in Lok Sabha polls, Union Minister Piyush Goyal is all set to give a tough fight to Congress\' Bhushan Patil from the Mumbai North seat.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Gopal Shetty from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Lok Sabha seat, defeating Congress actor-politician Urmila Matondkar by over 4.65 lakh votes. There were 16.47 lakh eligible voters in the 2019 elections from this constituency. Congress candidate Bhushan Patil said that him being a local will benefit his constituency.\n\nOmar Abdullah (Baramulla)\n\nNational Conference (NC) leader and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah is pitted against Sajad Lone of the Peoples Conference (PC) and Mir Mohammad Fayaz of Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nPeople\'s Conference President Sajad Lone slammed the National Conference leader, Omar Abdullah, and urged the people of Kashmir to stop him from humiliating the region by defeating him from the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat.\n\nLadakh\n\nThe Ladakh Lok Sabha seat will go to the polls with an interesting battle between Congress, BJP and an independent candidate. The largest Lok Sabha seat in the country in terms of area, Ladakh does not seem to be an easy ride for the BJP as there have been demands for sixth schedule status and also full statehood.\n\nThe BJP has replaced its sitting MP, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, with Tashi Gyalson, the Chief Executive Councillor and Chairman of the Hill Council (Leh). Congress has fielded Tsering Namgyal, who previously led the opposition in the Hill Council.\n\nThe election is taking place among demand both in Kargil and Leh for 6th Schedule status and separate statehood for Ladakh.\n\nUjjwal Nikam vs Varsha Gaikwad (Mumbai North Central)\n\nIn a bid to retain the sitting seat, the BJP has fielded 26/11 special prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, replacing two-time MP Poonam Mahajan against Congress\' Varsha Gaikwad from Maharashtra\'s Mumbai North Central Lok Sabha seat.\n\nVarsha Gaikwad is currently serving as Dharavi MLA. Nikam, a senior Public Prosecutor, has appeared for the government in several high-profile cases, including the 26/11 Mumbai attack case.\n\nKaran Bhushan Singh (Kaiserganj)\n\nThe seat, Kaiserganj, belonged to MP Brij Bhushan Singh. But the ruling party has decided to pass the ticket to former WFI president\'s son, Karan Bhushan Singh. The move from the Bharatiya Janata Party retains the seat\'s contest within the family, highlighting the influence of the six-time Member of Parliament.\n\nThe 67-year-old BJP\'s strong man was not given a ticket in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls as the former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief has been accused of sexual harassment by six women wrestlers, who had protested against him for a long period last year. Earlier this month, a Delhi court ordered that charges be levied against him.\n\nIn the 2019 election, Brij Bhusan Singh got 5,81,358 votes, beating BSP candidate 3,19,757.\n\nChirag Paswan (Hajipur)\n\nLJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan is aiming to carry forward father Ram Vilas Paswan\'s legacy. He is pitted against RJD\'s Shiv Chandra Ram.\n\nFrom 1977 to 2014, the seat was won eight times by Ram Vilas Paswan, who lost only twice, in 1984 and 2009. Chirag\'s decision to shift his constituency from Jamui to Hajipur, which has been a stronghold for the LJP, is aimed at asserting his position as the political heir to his father. In the 2019 elections, LJP candidate and Chirag Paswan\'s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras emerged victorious, securing the seat for the first time, defeating RJD\'s Shiv Chandra Ram with a margin of 2,05,449 votes.\n\nRohini Acharya (Saran)\n\nRohini Acharya, the daughter of Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, is contesting against BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy.\n\nBJP\'s Rajiv Pratap Rudy recorded resounding wins against Lalu Prasad\'s kin in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Will the Bihta airport ever be built? Why has the BJP failed to prevent yet another paper leak? Why has Patna University been denied central university status?"" the Congress general secretary said in a post on X.\n\nHe said Patna witnessed large-scale waterlogging and flooding in 2019 and 2020 but funds received under the Smart City and the Namami Gange projects have still gone ""grossly underutilised"".\n\nSix sewage treatment plants (STPs) and five new sewerage networks were sanctioned under these schemes but only four of the 11 projects have been completed, he said.\n\n""According to a CAG report on the six plants under the Namami Gange project, \'None of the six STPs and their networks are completed in their entirety, even as the executing agency, Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation, was sanctioned almost the entire cost of the projects, amounting to Rs 3,288.69 crore\',"" Ramesh said.\n\nCurrently, all of Patna\'s STPs combined have the capacity to treat only half of the city\'s daily discharge, he said.\n\nAs a result, a significant portion of sewage, domestic and biomedical waste is being released directly into the Ganga, he claimed.\n\nHe asked why these crucial infrastructure projects are lagging so far behind schedule.\n\n""Can the prime minister tell us why public money has been so poorly utilised?"" Ramesh said.\n\nHe further said eight years after it was approved in 2016, there is no sign that the Bihta airport will ever be built.\n\nStates such as Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have received plenty of airports under the Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) scheme but Bihar has been left behind, he claimed.\n\n""Phase I of construction was supposed to begin in October 2017 and be completed in two years\' time. The timeline was then revised for construction to start in 2018 and be completed by 2021. Although the state government transferred the required land to the centre by 2018, only a boundary wall has been built till date,"" the Congress leader said.\n\n""Can the prime minister explain why Bihar has been neglected under the UDAN scheme? Will the Bihta airport ever be built?"" he asked.\n\nRamesh also raised the issue of examination paper leaks and said it was found this month that the NEET-UG question paper was leaked to 20 aspirants in Patna.\n\n""Under the Modi sarkar, paper leaks have become a regular occurrence. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh has witnessed more than 40 paper leaks under BJP rule and Gujarat has emerged as the paper leak capital, from where leaks are orchestrated across the country,"" he said.\n\nEach paper leak takes a massive emotional toll on thousands, if not lakhs of young aspirants who prepare tirelessly for government exams, he said.\n\n""Why have paper leaks been so rampant under the Modi sarkar? Is the BJP doing anything to ensure that aspirants never have to face such injustice again?"" Ramesh asked.\n\nThe Congress leader also claimed that in 2017, Modi ""flat-out denied"" Nitish Kumar\'s request to give central university status to Patna University.\n\nThis has been a long-standing demand of the people of Bihar because students from modest backgrounds are currently forced to leave the state for quality higher education, he said.\n\n""Many poor families are not able to afford this either. Therefore, central university status for Patna University would change the lives of thousands of students. Why, then, has Prime Minister Modi so callously ignored the plight of Bihar\'s youth?"" Ramesh asked and urged the prime minister to break his ""silence"" on these issues.'"

This election cycle prominently featured the use of social media and other digital platforms as powerful campaign tools. Approximately one-third of the campaign budget was allocated for communication, enabling parties to use these platforms to connect closely with voters and promote their agendas.\n\nIn West Bengal, however, candidates appeared reluctant to abandon traditional campaigning methods. Political parties showed a strong preference for combining established mass outreach techniques with modern digital strategies.\n\nVeteran Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy, who represents the Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal, highlighted the significance of traditional campaigning methods over digital ones. He values face-to-face interactions, distributing leaflets, and directly engaging with voters.\n\n""I believe in traditional campaigning. People want to see the candidates in the fray.

In addition, we have wall graffiti with the party\'s messages written on them,"" the septuagenarian leader said.\n\nAccording to the experienced leader, digital campaigning may be popular elsewhere, but not in Dum Dum.\n\n""Traditional methods of campaigning are very important. All the country\'s top leaders including the PM are touring across the nation to address rallies,"" Roy said.\n\nHis opponent, CPI(M)\'s Sujan Chakraborty, echoed this sentiment, favouring door-to-door campaigns and personal interactions despite the sweltering heat.\n\nBoth parties utilised traditional methods, such as songs, poems, and street performances, to communicate their messages.\n\nDespite their ideological differences, both candidates share a similar approach to campaigning.\n\n""I believe in door-to-door campaigns in spite of the hot and sultry weather. I campaign on foot for three to four hours in the morning,"" he said.\n\nBesides visiting localities, he is making it a point to visit local markets, shops and meeting people personally.\n\n""All the tested and tried formulae of campaigning through songs, poetries, rhymes and street plays are being used to spread the party\'s message to people,"" Chakraborty said.\n\n""At times, I am also organising roadshows,"" he said.\n\nHowever, some candidates recognise the significance of online campaigning, particularly in reaching out to the youth.\n\nSaira Shah Halim, the CPI(M) candidate for Dakshin Kolkata Lok Sabha seat, highlighted the use of digital technology and AI to engage with first-time voters.\n\n""We are using digital technology to the hilt.

It is a well-established fact that Narendra Modi has spent the last decade working only for his few chosen friends,"" he said in a series of posts on X.\n\n""As a result, MSMEs have contributed to the lowest fraction of GDP in decades, face the highest tax rates in decades, and are dealing with severe job losses and price rise. Thousands of MSMEs have been shutting down,"" he added.\n\nThe Congress general secretary pointed to six major issues relating to ""Modi-made MSME mismanagement"", which include demonetisation that, he said, affected MSMEs the most and ""shoddy"" implementation of the GST regime.\n\nCiting reasons for small businesses shutting down, Ramesh alleged that policies favour ""crony corporates"", ""ill-conceived Income Tax 45-day payment rule"", uncontrolled dumping of Chinese goods, and the MSME board being captured by ""BJP cronies"".\n\nHis remarks came after reports citing a survey said 72 per cent of MSMEs have been stagnant since the past five years.\n\nElaborating further, the Congress leader claimed that eight years after demonetisation, ""it has become clear that demonetisation did nothing to curb black money or counterfeit currency in India"".\n\n""Unable to pay employees or repay their debts, many small businesses were forced to close. Business systematically moved from smaller firms to bigger, more organised players. An RBI study has shown that MSMEs were the worst affected by demonetisation,"" he added.\n\n""Overall growth cratered after demonetisation and has not recovered since then. Even before the pandemic, India\'s GDP growth rate was at a 10-year low in 2019. This policy blunder shows the BJP\'s misplaced priorities and lack of concern for small businesses,"" he alleged.\n\nThe implementation of GST was another instance where the BJP failed to consider how policy changes would impact MSMEs, Ramesh said.\n\nThe Congress leader said despite the various issues faced by the MSME sector, policies are made only for ""crony industrialists"".\n\nRamesh alleged the electoral bonds ""scam"" also affected MSMEs and said, ""Having taken Rs 8,000 crore from large corporates as electoral bonds \'chanda (donation)\', the BJP\'s quid-pro-quo only extends to those large corporates who can afford to pay huge bribes. MSMEs trying to conduct business honestly are left out.""\n\n""The Modi sarkar\'s latest disastrous anti-MSME move has been the Income-Tax department\'s 45-day payment rule ... The complete incompetence of the Modi government has created a policy that dis-incentivises doing business with MSMEs,"" he claimed.\n\nRamesh claimed large companies have been cancelling their orders from MSMEs out of fear of higher tax liabilities and switching purchases to unregistered companies.\n\nMSME associations have approached the government in despair, he said.\n\n""This situation will end on June 4. The Congress Nyay Patra has promised a sea change in the business environment in India, ending tax terrorism and arbitrary policies, promising an MSME-first business policy,"" Ramesh asserted.\n\nThe uncontrolled dumping of Chinese goods, he said, is another factor affecting MSMEs. Immediately after the BJP took power in 2014, imports from China shot up.\n\nThe percentage of imports from China were at 11 per cent of the total before 2014 but jumped up to 16 per cent by 2016 and has stayed there for 10 years, according to the Congress leader.\n\n""The share of industrial goods from China has increased even more, to 30 per cent of the total imported,"" he said.\n\nRamesh also alleged that the MSME board has been ""captured by BJP cronies"".\n\n""The MSME board advises the MSME ministry on policy and utilisation of funds. It is supposed to raise the voices of the small businesses of India to the government, and ensure policy is made keeping their interests in mind,"" Ramesh said.'"

As BJP leader Piyush Goyal faces the challenge of overcoming the ""outsider"" tag, Congress\'s Bhushan Patil is riding on the badge of being a ""bhoomi putra"" (son of the soil) in Mumbai North seat. Goyal is pitted in a straight fight with Patil for the May 20 election.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Varsha Gaikwad called Goyal an ""outsider"" earlier this month.\n\nSlamming the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi for labelling him as an outsider, Goyal said, ""There can be nobody more Mumbaikar than me.""\n\n""That is a very ridiculous argument. Not even worth responding to. I am a born Mumbaikar. Lived in Mumbai all my life, worked in Mumbai all my life,"" Goyal told PTI during a roadshow.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha MP, who started his career as a chartered accountant, is the son of former BJP minister Vedprakash Goyal and Chandrakanta Goyal, three-term BJP MLA from Matunga.\n\nGoyal said he was born in Mumbai, studied in H R College and Government Law College, and started his Chartered Accountancy practice in Lalbaug and worked as an investment banker on Nepean Sea Road.\n\nThe opportunity of proving his salt as a Mumbaikar comes with the challenge of matching up to the big winning margin of 4.65 lakh votes recorded by BJP\'s Gopal Shetty in the last election.\n\nOf the 9.88 lakh votes polled in 2019, Shetty got 7.05 lakh while actor and Congress nominee Urmila Matondkar polled 2.41 lakh.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress\' Patil is asserting his identity as a local resident and a ""Maharashtrian"" to garner maximum votes for his party.\n\nThe Congress leader is also attempting to tap the BJP\'s traditional vote bank, the Gujarati community, by involving his wife, a Gujarati Jain, in his campaign.\n\nPatil enjoys the support of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Vinod Ghosalkar whose son, former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar, was killed in Borivali earlier this year during a Facebook Live interaction with his constituents.\n\nPatil said he is a ""bhoomi putra"" (son of the soil) who would continue to live among his voters in Borivali and would be approachable 24x7 to resolve their grievances.\n\nGoyal\'s candidature was declared much earlier than that of Patil, so the BJP leader has had an early mover advantage, holding rallies and crisscrossing the constituency much before Patil\'s nomination was announced.\n\nVanchit Bahujan Aghadi\'s advocate Sonal D Gondane is another candidate in the fray.\n\nHistorically, the Mumbai North seat has been a BJP bastion with former union minister Ram Naik winning five straight elections from 1989 till 2004.\n\nIn the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, actor Govinda, who was the Congress candidate, defeated Naik.\n\nIn 2009, Sanjay Nirupam was elected as a Congress candidate.

He advocates for a prime minister who values unity and effective management, contrasting autocratic tendencies.Opposition parties, campaigning together or against each other, will join hands after the Lok Sabha polls, says Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, asserting that the people will get a prime minister who is first among equals and listens to others with an INDIA bloc coalition government. Including the Trinamool Congress in his argument on opposition parties getting together after the ""day of reckoning"" on June 4, Tharoor said in an interaction with PTI editors at the news agency\'s headquarters that a coalition government is nothing to be afraid of.\n\n""The growth performance of the Indian economy has been better under such dispensations than under single party governments,"" he said.\n\nIn his view, this is an election for ""change"" and as of now the BJP has ""lost its grip"" on the narrative.\n\nThe Congress Working Committee (CWC) member also defended the party\'s decision to not attend the \'pran pratishtha\' ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying it was right to turn down the invitation as it was ""essentially a political platform for the greater glorification of Prime Minister Narendra Modi"".\n\n""It would have been a mistake in my view had we done it. As a purely political decision, it was the right one,"" he said during the freewheeling interaction.\n\nTharoor said it is true a coalition government functions very differently from a monolithic one-party government.\n\n""Given Mr Modi\'s style, the personality cult built around him, and the way the BJP has been ruling, I think it is fair to say that it (an INDIA bloc government) would be very unlike what we have seen in the last 10 years,"" he said, confident that the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) will form the next government.\n\nThe record and experience of the Indian public with coalition governments has been rather good, the former Union minister said.\n\n""So, in many ways the advantage of a coalition is that there won\'t be any sort of autocratic tendencies whoever becomes prime minister... they will have to take into account the others. Frankly, it is the classic political theory of parliamentary systems of governance. Right now we are seeing a parliamentary system being run presidentially which is the worst of both the worlds,"" Tharoor argued.\n\n""If you have a coalition government of the INDIA bloc, you are going to see, for the first time in a long while, a PM who is first among equals, who has to listen to others, take their point of view into account and who would have to be a good manager,"" he said.\n\n""Mr (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee is considered in many ways an excellent example of that kind of consensus builder. He did not have a majority, far from it... he had 26 parties in his coalition but his government was able to deliver effective results and at the same time reassure Indians that they had a functioning government,"" Tharoor said.\n\nThe author-politician also hailed former prime minister Manmohan Singh\'s style of governance, saying he was able to pursue ""very relentlessly"" his economic goal and preside over the best growth period India has ever seen.\n\nNoting that the coalition of UPA-1 broke and the Left quit the government and was not part of UPA-2, Tharoor said there is always the issue on which a prime minister may have to draw the line for one or more of his coalition partners.\n\n""So my own view is let us be reassured that our history in operating the system in the Constitution we have has by and large safeguarded the interest of the people. There have been many periods when people have been absolutely doomsaying about our country and we have come through all those periods,"" he said.\n\n""I would say... coalition government is nothing to be afraid of and certainly when I speak to most voters they are thinking in terms of who is the candidate \'I am voting for\', what values does he or she represent, who do they bring to power in Delhi and how is that power going to be exercised,"" Tharoor said.\n\nAsked about contradictions in the INDIA bloc as seen in bitter exchanges between the Congress and the Left in Kerala and whether that would be an impediment in the formation of a cohesive government, Tharoor pointed out that the UPA and the Vajpayee-led NDA before that came together after the elections.\n\n""So the truth is that in our country coalitions come after the polling...This is an unusual case where a serious attempt was made to bring people together before voting even took place. It was very clear to all of us that the coalition will work on a state by state basis,"" he said.\n\nCiting the example of Kerala, Tharoor said it was unthinkable that the Congress which leads the UDF and the Communists who lead the LDF would ever be partners in the state.\n\n""We have been fighting each other and at loggerheads for the last 55 years and alternating in power until the last election, so there was no question of that even being feasible.

Consequently, he posed several questions: Firstly, whether the PM would be willing to make the data and its source public. Secondly, why the analysis stopped at 2019, and what transpired between 2019 and 2024. Lastly, if 6 crore jobs were generated in one sector alone, he inquired about the total job creation between 2014 and 2019.\n\nThe former finance minister further asked the PM: ""4.

Addressing an election rally at Darbhanga, Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat where riots had erupted after the incident, also alleged that the RJD supremo had acted in connivance with the Congress, which headed the UPA, in power at the Centre.\n\nThis is probably the first time Modi raised the Godhra issue during the ongoing elections.\n\nWithout mentioning Prasad by name, Modi described the RJD supremo, who was the Railway minister in the first UPA government, as one ""serving sentences, out on bail (in fodder scam cases)"".\n\n""He had tried to shield those who were responsible for the Godhra train burning incident in which more than 60 kar sevaks were burnt alive. Was it not the reign of Sonia (Gandhi) madam"", remarked PM, referring to the former Congress president and UPA chairperson.\n\nModi recalled that the Banerjee Commission, although headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, was often called ""ben raazi (the sister is willing)"", and ""under pressure"" from Prasad it submitted a ""bogus"" report that ""tried to exonerate those who were guilty and put the blame on kar sevaks themselves"".\n\n""But the court consigned the report to the dustbin. Those who were guilty got punished, some of them even getting death sentences,"" said the prime minister.\n\nModi alleged that all constituents of the opposition bloc INDIA had a propensity towards ""appeasement"" and lambasted the RJD for ""counting Muslims among armed forces"".\n\nThe remark seemed an oblique reference to Tejashwi Yadav, the RJD president\'s son and heir apparent who has spoken of ""all the three armed forces being headed by Hindus"" while slamming the ruling BJP at the Centre for repeatedly claiming that the faith of the majority community was ""in danger"".\n\nIn his speech which lasted for more than 30 minutes, Modi also took potshots at Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, mentioning neither by name but observing ""there is a \'shehzada\' (crown prince) in Delhi. Likewise there is a \'shehzada\' in Patna. Both have had a dismal track record"".\n\n""Their tendency for appeasement makes them behave in this fashion. Earlier, they had insulted the armed forces by raising questions on surgical strikes. We never think in terms of Hindus and Muslims while talking about our armed forces and our martyrs,"" the prime minister said.\n\nModi also alleged that in 2007, when Prasad was the railway minister, ""he had advocated reservations for Muslims"" and that the RJD supremo and Congress ""want to divert quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs, who feel disillusionment towards them"".\n\n""These parties are going against Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar and even Jawaharlal Nehru, both of whom were opposed to reservations along religious lines...... but let me assure you, as long as Modi is alive, nobody can snatch away reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs,"" said the PM at the rally here.\n\nSlamming the INDIA bloc for ""spreading lies that I want to change the Constitution, which I worship"", Modi said, ""I have been challenging them for 12 days to give in writing that they will not snatch away quotas meant for deprived people and provide these along religious lines. They are yet to do so"".\n\nThe prime minister also noted that the Mithila region, named after an ancient kingdom of which Darbhanga was the capital, was the land of Goddess Sita, and therefore, had special sentiments for Ram temple at Ayodhya.\n\n""India was first attacked on its western boundary about 1,000 years ago. It led to a millennium of enslavement. When we freed Ayodhya after a nearly-500-year-long fight, I had said that for the next 1,000 years, India will script a new history,"" said Modi who also asserted that the country had begun to get its rightful place in the comity of nations.\n\n""When bad days fell on the nation, Bihar was among the worst sufferers. We must not allow the state to return to the era of the lantern"", said Modi, referring to the RJD\'s poll symbol.\n\nHe also made an indirect reference to the land-for-jobs scam under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate in which Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Yadav have been named, saying ""the people of Bihar have been made to do away with their land to get jobs"".\n\n""The people of Bihar must also not forgive constituents of the INDIA bloc, which ruled Delhi and Maharashtra when mass exodus of labourers took place during the COVID pandemic"", asserted the prime minister.\n\nHe also lauded ally Nitish Kumar, the Bihar chief minister who heads the JD(U), for his governance track record.\n\nModi added, ""We had been occupying the 11th spot among economies of the world. Now we are the fifth largest economy"".\n\nReferring to the ""inheritance tax"" controversy, the prime minister alleged that ""the Congress wants to bring in a law by which one will be deprived of 55 per cent of whatever one\'s parents have earned and saved. They wish to place a fatwa on one\'s inheritance"".\n\nIn keeping with his penchant for connecting with locals wherever he goes, the prime minister addressed the rally wearing the traditional headgear ""Mithila paag"", on which the lotus, the BJP\'s poll symbol, was printed.\n\nHe also took note of an enthusiastic supporter who brought a cut-out of the PM to the venue.\n\n""I appreciate that you have made Modi dance.

Speaking with a group of select journalists in Pune, Sitharaman pointed out that the police report has been filed in a Congress-ruled state. ""The closure report says he had a wrong certificate of SC (Scheduled Caste), and he was not an SC. But, the family of Vemula was dragged and exhibited in the country when it was grieving.

The wrong narrative came from ""vested interest groups, self-appointed left liberal group, self-appointed leader in the opposition, who says \'mohabbat ki dukan\',"" she said. ""He actually perpetrated this problem, spoke so badly in Parliament about his interpretation (of the incident),"" Sitharaman alleged.\n\nWhen she said that rigorous research will have to be done with methodology, with data and without getting confused with the political narrative, this was what she meant, the minister told the students. ""The problem which could have been addressed amicably within the university, without dishonoring any particular student or family, was dragged to the streets of the country and allegations were levied against then education minister and central government as it was a central university,"" she said. The intolerance, political interference and hate lay not with the government but the vested interest groups which ""do not lose an opportunity to bring this toxin into centres of higher education,"" Sitharaman claimed.

Hence, he is requesting Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray to join him. This proves our claim Modi will not come back to power.""\n\nThe Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP (SP), along with the Congress, are part of the opposition bloc Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar\'s NCP are allies of the BJP and constituents of the ruling \'Mahayuti\' alliance.\n\nTo a query on a Pune court verdict in the 2013 murder case of well-known rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, in which two accused were convicted, while three others were let-off, Patole said he welcomes the ruling ""but the (alleged) mastermind in this case Virendrasinh Tawde and his entire team have been acquitted"". This was not an ordinary criminal case and the mastermind should be brought to justice, emphasised the Congress leader.\n\nTo a query on Modi\'s attack on former CM Thackeray during a poll rally, Patole said his remarks were laughable and in poor taste.\n\nAsked about the PM\'s statement that if the Congress comes back to power, it will put a ""Babri lock"" on the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Patole asserted that a government led by his party will make the shrine better than what it is now. ""The Congress supports the stand taken by four Shankaracharyas (pontiffs of major Hindu shrines) on the Ram temple consecration ceremony (which they did not attend). They will be invited for a grand puja at the temple (if Congress comes to power),"" he added.'"

He asserted that both the TMC and Left parties prioritize their vote banks over the state's welfare, claiming they have diminished Bengal's prospects with their undemocratic practices.\n\nOn the other hand, Congress leader is to push for his party candidates in Punjab where he is set to address rallies.\n\nAs the Lok Sabha elections progress, with the final phase scheduled for June 1 in several constituencies across states and Union territories, PM Modi emphasized the need for change from the existing political landscape, which he believes has failed to uplift Bengal."""

Excited young girls reciprocate, flashing a \'V\' back at her.\n\nShambhavi (25) is the daughter of Ashok Choudhary, minister of rural works department in Bihar and a close ally of CM Nitish Kumar. She is also the country\'s youngest parliamentary candidate.\n\nShambhavi is contesting the Samastipur (SC) seat as the NDA candidate on the nomination of LJP (RV). The constituency is the birthplace of late socialist leader and former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur, who is acknowledged nationwide as the master of social engineering. Thakur, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna this year, was elected to the Lok Sabha from Samastipur in 1977. ""I am lucky for making my political debut from this sacred place,"" she tells ET when asked why she picked Samastipur for her electoral foray.\n\nShambhavi, who did her graduation from Delhi University\'s Lady Shri Ram College and MA in sociology from Delhi School of Economics, is locked in a direct contest with Sunny Hazari, a nominee of Congress, who is contesting as part of RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance).\n\nSunny (33) is the son of Maheshwar Hazari, minister of information and public relations in the Nitish Kumar government.

406,406,"b'Agartala, May 17 (SocialNews.XYZ) The BJP government in Tripura is preparing to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Chief Minister Manik Saha announced here on Friday amid opposition from other political parties which fear the new law will trigger communal tensions in the state.\n\nSpeaking to the media on the sidelines of a blood donation camp at a mosque here, Saha said that after directions from the Centre, the state government is preparing to implement CAA in Tripura.\n\nTo recall, on March 11, the Centre notified the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules 2024, thus paving the way for enforcing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which seeks to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before December 31, 2014.\n\nFollowing the advice of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), a six-member state-level empowered committee with the Director of Census Operations as its chairman was formed in Tripura recently to grant citizenship under the CAA.\n\n""After the advice of the MHA, like other states and Union Territories in the country, a state-level empowered committee was constituted for granting Indian citizenship under the CAA. District-level committees headed by the District Magistrates of all the eight districts were also formed accordingly,"" Rabindra Reang, Director of Census Operations, Tripura, told IANS.\n\nHe said the district-level empowered committees would receive applications under the CAA and scrutinise them before forwarding the same to the empowered panel.\n\nThe official said those who want Indian citizenship under the CAA will have to apply to the district-level committee for consideration.\n\nUnder the Act, those living in areas under the Tribal Autonomous Council, which was constituted under the Sixth schedule of the Constitution, are not eligible to apply for citizenship, the official said.\n\nTripura has a lone tribal autonomous body -- Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council -- which has jurisdiction over two-thirds of Tripura\'s 10,491 sq km area, and is home to over 12,16,000 people, of which around 84 per cent are tribals.\n\nAlong with the opposition CPI-M and Congress, the Tipra Motha Party (TMP), a new ally of the BJP in the state, has also been opposing the CAA since the very beginning.\n\nTMP founder Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma on Friday doubted the implementation of CAA in its present form, saying anyone who has illegally entered the state may claim citizenship with false documents, and verifying the authenticity of such documents is also very tough.\n\nImplementation of CAA in its present form is not acceptable, he told the media.\n\n""We may be a partner of the BJP but our party\'s principles and policies are very clear. We do not want demographic changes in any of the northeastern states, because the number of indigenous people in the region is small and if we do not have a proper system, many people can come and claim that they have been here for years.""\n\nStrongly opposing the BJP government\'s decision, opposition leader and CPI-M state Secretary Jitendra Choudhury reiterated his party\'s longstanding opposition to the CAA, saying he has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the Act.\n\nHe also expressed concern that the implementation of CAA will negatively impact the entire northeastern region, which has suffered due to significant influxes in the past.\n\nChoudhury claimed that to get political mileage during the Lok Sabha elections and to divert attention from the electoral bond issue, the CAA is being implemented now.\n\nCongress MLA and former minister Sudip Roy Barman echoed these concerns.\n\nExpressing sympathy with the persecuted minorities in the neighboring countries, Roy Barman said he fears that implementing CAA could reignite tribal insurgency in Tripura by further marginalising the tribal community.\n\nHe also claimed that granting citizenship to foreigners based on religion would strain India\'s financial resources and encourage fundamentalist forces across the border, making the CAA an ineffective solution.'"

425,425,"b'Agartala, May 17 (VOICE) The BJP government in Tripura is preparing to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Chief Minister Manik Saha announced here on Friday amid opposition from other political parties which fear the new law will trigger communal tensions in the state.Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a blood donation camp at a mosque here, Saha said that after directions from the Centre, the state government is preparing to implement CAA in Tripura.\n\nTo recall, on March 11, the Centre notified the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules 2024, thus paving the way for enforcing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which seeks to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before December 31, 2014.\n\nFollowing the advice of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), a six-member state-level empowered committee with the Director of Census Operations as its chairman was formed in Tripura recently to grant citizenship under the CAA.\n\n""After the advice of the MHA, like other states and Union Territories in the country, a state-level empowered committee was constituted for granting Indian citizenship under the CAA. District-level committees headed by the District Magistrates of all the eight districts were also formed accordingly,"" Rabindra Reang, Director of Census Operations, Tripura, told VOICE.\n\nHe said the district-level empowered committees would receive applications under the CAA and scrutinise them before forwarding the same to the empowered panel.\n\nThe official said those who want Indian citizenship under the CAA will have to apply to the district-level committee for consideration.\n\nUnder the Act, those living in areas under the Tribal Autonomous Council, which was constituted under the Sixth schedule of the Constitution, are not eligible to apply for citizenship, the official said.\n\nTripura has a lone tribal autonomous body -- Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council -- which has jurisdiction over two-thirds of Tripura\'s 10,491 sq km area, and is home to over 12,16,000 people, of which around 84 per cent are tribals.\n\nAlong with the opposition CPI-M and Congress, the Tipra Motha Party (TMP), a new ally of the BJP in the state, has also been opposing the CAA since the very beginning.\n\nTMP founder Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma on Friday doubted the implementation of CAA in its present form, saying anyone who has illegally entered the state may claim citizenship with false documents, and verifying the authenticity of such documents is also very tough.\n\nImplementation of CAA in its present form is not acceptable, he told the media.\n\n""We may be a partner of the BJP but our party\'s principles and policies are very clear. We do not want demographic changes in any of the northeastern states, because the number of indigenous people in the region is small and if we do not have a proper system, many people can come and claim that they have been here for years.""\n\nStrongly opposing the BJP government\'s decision, opposition leader and CPI-M state Secretary Jitendra Choudhury reiterated his party\'s longstanding opposition to the CAA, saying he has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the Act.\n\nHe also expressed concern that the implementation of CAA will negatively impact the entire northeastern region, which has suffered due to significant influxes in the past.\n\nChoudhury claimed that to get political mileage during the Lok Sabha elections and to divert attention from the electoral bond issue, the CAA is being implemented now.\n\nCongress MLA and former minister Sudip Roy Barman echoed these concerns.\n\nExpressing sympathy with the persecuted minorities in the neighboring countries, Roy Barman said he fears that implementing CAA could reignite tribal insurgency in Tripura by further marginalising the tribal community.\n\nHe also claimed that granting citizenship to foreigners based on religion would strain India\'s financial resources and encourage fundamentalist forces across the border, making the CAA an ineffective solution.'"

This will help the entire family as she looks after all at home,"" he added.\n\nRahul Gandhi also assured the jobless youth that the new INDIA bloc government would enact a law guaranteeing all educated youngsters a job for minimum one year to give them start, plus deposit Rs 1 lakh a year into their bank accounts.\n\nEarlier, Rahul Gandhi was accorded a warm and traditional Marathi style welcome with a \'Puneri feta\' (headgear), a shawl, and a statuette of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.'"

432,432,"b'Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has promised to remove the 50-per cent reservation cap in the country. Addressing a public gathering in the city on Friday, Gandhi made a bold proclamation, stating that if the INDIA bloc came to power after the Lok Sabha elections, the reservation limit will be abolished.\n\nThe announcement comes amidst ongoing discussions within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regarding potential changes to the Constitution, including proposals to end reservation policies. Gandhi\'s statement serves as a direct challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to consider the removal of the reservation limit.\n\nAs political tensions escalate in the lead-up to the elections, Gandhi\'s declaration set the stage for intensified debate and scrutiny over the future of reservation policies in India.\n\nRahul Gandhi addressed a campaign meeting organised for Maha Vikas Aghadi Lok Sabha candidate Ravindra Dhangekar. During his speech, Gandhi highlighted the significance of the Constitution in upholding the rights of marginalised communities.\n\n""The country comprises 15 per cent Dalits, 8 per cent tribals, and 50 per cent underprivileged communities. The Constitution bestowed rights upon these people of the country. Without the Constitution, there would be no justice. If the BJP were to abolish the Constitution, the country\'s identity would be erased. We will not permit the Constitution crafted by Dr Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi to be disregarded,"" said Rahul Gandhi.\n\nAsserting the importance of preserving the Constitution, Gandhi emphasised that it serves as the foundation of the country\'s identity and guarantees the Fundamental Rights to all citizens. He warned against any attempts to undermine or dismantle the Constitution, stating that such actions would erase the country\'s identity.\n\nRahul Gandhi launched scathing criticism against a section of the media for its purported neglect of the issues faced by the poor, contrasting it with the extensive coverage given to events such as weddings in affluent households like the Ambanis.\n\nHe pointed out the influence of Adani, who controls much of the media landscape, and highlighted the alleged scam involving Electoral Bonds, worth thousands of crores, which has not received adequate media attention.\n\nGandhi further accused the BJP government of prioritising the interests of a select few, including Adani, at the expense of the majority. He cited the waiver of loans amounting to approximately Rs 16 lakh crore for a privileged few, asserting that this amount could have been utilised to alleviate the burden of farmers\' loans for the next 24 years.\n\nMoreover, Gandhi criticised Prime Minister Modi for purportedly neglecting key issues such as farmers\' welfare, labour rights, and unemployment. He reminded Modi\'s pledge to eradicate corruption in India. He highlighted the alleged corruption involving electoral bonds, which the Supreme Court has deemed illegal, and questioned the BJP\'s reluctance to disclose the names of donors.\n\nGandhi also levelled serious allegations against a company involved in a CBI inquiry, accusing it of making substantial payments worth thousands of crores. These allegations underscored Gandhi\'s broader critique of the BJP government\'s alleged favouritism and lack of transparency in governance.'"
433,433,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Animated videos shared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s party targeting opposition Congress and the Muslim community have evoked complaints and outrage, as the political climate in India heats up midway through its six-week long election.\n\nThe videos, shared by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on social media platforms Instagram and X over the last ten days, depict the Congress giving disproportionate benefits to India\'s minority Muslim community, at the cost of certain disadvantaged tribal and Hindu caste groups.\n\nThe Congress, in a complaint to the poll watchdog Election Commission, said on Sunday that the video has been shared ""clearly with an intention to wantonly provocate rioting and promote enmity between different religions"".\n\nA set of guidelines mutually adopted by political parties for how they should conduct themselves during the election period prohibit them from creating ""mutual hatred"" between caste, religious or linguistic groups.\n\nManipulated videos on social media have also become a contentious issue in this election, such as fake videos showing top Bollywood stars criticizing the prime minister.\n\nOn Monday, the commission warned parties against the misuse of AI tools to create deep fakes and told them not to publish and circulate such videos. It also said parties had been directed to remove such content within three hours of it being brought to their notice.\n\nModi, the face of the Hindu-nationalist BJP, seeking a rare third consecutive term, had focused his campaign largely on his government\'s performance on economic growth and welfare benefits.\n\nBut he changed tack after the first phase of voting on April 19 and his campaign speeches have since become more polarising on religious lines, accusing Congress of planning to redistribute the wealth of the majority Hindus among minority Muslims, who he called ""infiltrators"" who have ""more children"".\n\nThe videos shared by the BJP over the last ten days, one of which has since been taken down, illustrated the same message.\n\nA 17-second video shared by a state unit of BJP on May 4, with over 8.5 million views, shows a character resembling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi feeding ""funds"" to a bird in a skullcap, which eventually pushes out from their common nest three other birds representing other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe Congress has filed a police complaint against BJP leaders for the video, BJP\'s head of information and technology Amit Malviya said on X.\n\n""The Congress should in fact thank the BJP for taking their manifesto to the people in a manner that even they couldn\'t,"" he wrote.\n\nThe video has elicited outrage. Nitasha Kaul, a politics professor at London\'s Westminster University said on X that the video was a ""straightforward 1930s Germany style cartoon"".\n\nIn its manifesto for the elections, the Congress has promised to tackle India\'s economic inequality by conducting a socio-economic caste census and extending affirmative action. It said it will ensure that minorities receive ""their fair share"" of education, economic and healthcare opportunities.\n\nAn Election Commission spokesperson, the BJP\'s Malviya and Congress spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik, additional reporting by Shivangi Acharya and Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Toby Chopra)'"

The JD(S) joined the BJP-led NDA in September last year.\n\nPrajwal Revanna is the grandson of former prime minister and JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda and was the JD(S)-BJP alliance candidate from the Hassan seat which went to polls on April 26.\n\nPrajwal\'s father H D Revanna was arrested by Special Investigation Team on Saturday in a kidnapping case linked to sexual abuse allegations against Prajwal, soon after a court here rejected his anticipatory bail plea.\n\nIn Gujarat, BJP\'s Mukesh Dalal has already won from Surat unopposed after the nomination of Congress\' Nilesh Kumbhani was rejected over irregularities in the signature of proposers and other candidates withdrew. The party had bagged all 26 seats in 2019.\n\nThe BJP is also hoping for a clean sweep in Madhya Pradesh, which sends 29 members to Lok Sabha. In 2019, the BJP failed to win the Chhindwara constituency, the only saving grace for the Congress which managed to retain it on the charisma of party veteran Kamal Nath. His son Nakul Nath won the seat last time.\n\nIn Guna, where votes of the Yadav community can tilt the scales, Scindia is facing Yadvendra Singh Yadav of Congress.\n\n""I am fully confident the BJP\'s flag will fly high in all the seats in Madhya Pradesh\'s Gwalior and Bhopal divisions (going to polls in 3rd phase),"" Scindia told reporters in Gwalior after arriving from New Delhi.\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, the BJP had bagged nine seats and Congress two seats out of the total 11 in 2019.\n\nIn Assam, the BJP has put up only one candidate in this phase for the Guwahati seat, while its alliance partners AGP are contesting in two - Dhubri and Barpeta - and the UPPL in Kokrajhar.\n\nThe Congress is contesting all four seats.\n\nThe constituencies going to the polls in the third phase in Bihar are Araria, Jhanjharpur, Supaul, Madhepura and Khagaria, all currently held by the NDA.\n\nIn Assam, Sashastra Seema Bal troops have been deployed on boats to polling stations in South Salmara Mankachar PC for the third phase of elections.

They do such things for votes and accuse others of using the bulldozer,"" Kharge asserted.\n\nHe also accused the BJP of creating false propaganda against the Congress every time it came out with schemes to help the poor during the UPA government. He said the prime minister is now accusing them for practising the politics of freebies.\n\nThe Congress chief said when the party first brought MGNREGA, Food Security Act, Rural Health mission, the BJP opposed them. He also cited land reforms and nationalisation of banks which were opposed by the BJP.\n\n""Whenever we introduced schemes for the poor, they criticised them. Now we are talking of giving double ration to the poor,"" he said.\n\nBrushing aside criticism of practising politics of appeasement, the Congress chief said, ""Stopping \'anyay\' (injustice) on any community is not appeasement. They (the BJP) try to polarise during elections. They try to project anything we do as appeasement. I would only say that the BJP does appeasement politics. By giving the poor something, or giving scholarship to the poor, giving education through special schools for Muslims cannot be termed as appeasement,"" Kharge noted.\n\nOn BJP\'s attack that the Congress wants to give religion-based quotas and that is why the call for raising the reservation ceiling, he said it is meant to provide reservation for the poor.\n\n""In Tamil Nadu, there is 69 per cent reservation. Is it for Muslims? We are saying we will raise the limit like in Tamil Nadu. How do the Muslims come in? We want to provide reservation for economically weaker sections and do Muslims not come in them?\n\n""They try to create misunderstanding about everything and whatever we do, everyone will get that. It will be for all,"" he asserted.\n\nJustifying the demand for holding a caste census, the Congress chief said it is to ensure giving something to communities have been left out in the past.\n\n""Wherever the poor need to be helped, backwards need the help, we will create a policy for them. Just like Jawaharlal Nehru formulated the five-year plans, similar things have to be given to those who have not been given the benefits of development so far. We are not snatching anyone\'s rights.\n\n""Whenever such things happen the BJP does such kind of propaganda. They used to do such things when land reforms were brought in, when nationalisation of banks happened. They create such misinformation. These people are of feudal mindset, that is why they speak such things,"" the Congress chief said.\n\nEarlier, he said, we promised to provide Rs 72,000 per annum and now we are saying we would give Rs 1 lakh to the poor. The Congress has done so in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Telangana.\n\n""We are doing it for the poor. This money will go to the poor and that will help increase their spending.

It is a transfer of power process, not just a book.\n\n""The transfer of power which started in 1947. If you see India\'s population, conduct a survey, then you will know nearly 90 per cent population is Dalit, tribals, OBC, minority.

441,441,"b'The 18th Lok Sabha elections spark a debate on inequality in India as Congress proposes a caste census, countered by BJP\'s accusations. The Supreme Court is re-evaluating Article 39(b) in a property dispute case, which could impact Parliament\'s ability to enact laws related to wealth distribution.Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question -- how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals. BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities.\n\nThe issue is philosophical: to whom do a country\'s material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the Supreme Court is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure ""that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common good"".\n\nNot just an academic question\n\nGenerally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a \'dustbin of sentiment\'. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C -- which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as equality and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case.\n\nThe trajectory of the case\n\nOf course, the expression \'material resources\' must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well?\n\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\nA recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that wealth inequality in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a \'wealth tax\' where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in.\n\nAnother example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down.\n\nThe real implications\n\nThe implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that \'invisible hand\' will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth.\n\nUnderlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others.\n\nA Gandhian vision of Article 39(b)\n\nDuring the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision.\n\nIt is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b). Private property may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust.\n\nThe authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy'"

This prime minister is fast losing his memory. He has never had any adherence to truth. He is \'jhoothjeevi\', but now what he says today, he forgets tomorrow and says he never said it.""\n\n""Of course he has been attacking the Congress party and has been talking of Hindu-Muslim,"" he said.\n\nRamesh said the PM had raised the issue of \'Muslim League\' imprint on the Congress manifesto, the mangalsutra remarks and the allegation that the Congress will give reservations on the basis of religion, which were all ""bogus statements"".\n\n""This is the prime minister who, when asked some years ago whether he had any remorse at the killings during the Gujarat riots, said even when a small puppy comes under a car, one feels bad.

So this has always been the objective of the BJP and the RSS. They are deeply uncomfortable and hostile to the idea of BR Ambedkar\'s Constitution because one of the pillars of this Constitution is social justice and the road to social justice is through reservation,"" he said.\n\nRamesh asked why Prime Minister Modi is ""silent"" on the issue of caste census.\n\nHe also asked the prime minister to clear his stance as to whether he will remove the 50 per cent cap on reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs.\n\n""Why has the PM not said a word on this, he is going around spreading an epidemic of lies that the Congress is giving reservations based on religion. Where have we given reservations based on religion? The 1994 reservations in Karnataka, which he keeps referring to, were given to minorities -- Muslims, Christians, Jains, Buddhists based on socio-economic criteria, and that is how they were introduced in the reservation law,"" he said.\n\n""Subsequently, the PM in an interview to a TV channel had said he himself given reservation to Muslims by adding them to OBC list. If PM does it, it is not religion-based reservation, if the Congress does it, even though it is based on socio-economic criteria, it is religion-based,"" Ramesh said.\n\nAsked about the prime minister\'s remark that his Adani-Ambani comments were validated by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury\'s comments, Ramesh said he does not know what the context of Chowdhury\'s remarks was but Modi should be asked why action has not been taken against the two businessmen.'"

Ramesh criticized Modi for not fulfilling these promises and accused him of making empty commitments.On a day Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned in Telangana, the Congress on Wednesday asked him to clear his stand on the caste census after he promised a sub-quota for the Madiga caste and wondered if that would be another of his ""jumlas"" (rhetoric).

The BJP had committed to establishing this factory in their 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto as well as their 2014 Telangana assembly election manifesto, he said.\n\nThe central government then released Rs 40 crore for the project and the Telangana government even allocated 60 acres of land for the same, Ramesh said, adding that two years later, in 2016, the Minister of State for Railways, Manoj Singh, abruptly declared that there was no scope for setting up a coach factory anywhere in the country.\n\nDespite this, a coach factory was set up in Maharashtra a few years later, just before the 2019 assembly elections, he claimed, adding that the prime minister then announced another Rs 20,000 crore electric locomotive plant in Gujarat in 2022.\n\nIn December 2022, he said, the Centre clarified again that no plant would be built in Kazipet but later that month, announced that a coach factory would be set up in Assam.\n\n""Before the Telangana assembly elections last year, the Centre reversed its decision yet again, and the PM laid the foundation stone of a railway wagon overhauling centre in Kazipet. Almost a year later, this plan too has failed to materialise.\n\n""Why have the PM and the BJP repeatedly deceived the people of Telangana?

Yet, the BJP did not hesitate to sweep these projects under the rug. CM Revanth Reddy has also pointed out that at the same time as these projects were being scrapped, massive projects like the bullet train and Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) were given to Gujarat, he added.\n\n""Why has the Modi Sarkar so callously neglected development projects in Telangana?

448,448,"b'Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly criticised the Congress party\'s proposal for wealth redistribution, calling it a dangerous idea. The controversy began when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pledged to conduct surveys to redistribute wealth to specific sections of society if the party comes to power. PM Modi warned that such policies could sow communal disharmony by targeting certain communities and discourage economic growth.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has castigated the Congress\' plan of wealth redistribution as a dangerous idea, in an interview with TOI yesterday.\n\nEarly this month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi promised that if the Congress is voted to power, the party would conduct a survey to run a check on who possesses the wealth in the country and undertake an exercise to redistribute the same. ""First, we will conduct a caste census to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes.

""This urban-naxal mindset, my mothers and sisters, they will not even leave your \'mangalsutra\'. They can go to that level,"" Modi said addressing a rally in Rajasthan\'s Banswara.\n\nUS-based Congress leader Sam Pitroda fuelled the controversy by proposing inheritance tax as a way to redistribute wealth. """"In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45% to his children, 55% is grabbed by the government. That\'s an interesting law,"" he said. He later said he was just giving an example. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that Pitroda\'s comments do not reflect the party\'s position.\n\nIn an interview to TOI yesterday, Modi analysed the Congress\' controversial idea in detail, calling it a ""Maoist"" idea. ""We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat. The threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see the Congress party and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. You would have seen the Yuvraj saying that we will do an X-ray. This X-ray is nothing but raiding every home. They will raid farmers to see how much land they possess. They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony,"" he said.\n\nRead the full interview: \'India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power\': PM Modi\n\nPM Modi said ideas of wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, but just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. ""These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions. Would you work day and night if the government will take away your money in the name of redistribution?"" he said.\n\nPM Modi said wealth redistribution will discourage a large number of people who are coming out of poverty with the government\'s help.\n\n""Today, we are empowering 3 crore women to become Lakhpati Didis. Such policies will ensure that women don\'t become Lakhpatis and their aspirations don\'t progress. If someone has taken a Mudra loan and is progressing, his growth will be stunted. Our street vendors who are now growing due to our policies will also not be able to grow. Today, we are the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. Such policies will kill the startup revolution by our youth. This policy is a way to please their vote bank,"" he said.\n\nHe said equitable growth can be ensured by removing barriers and empowering people. ""This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier 2 and 3 cities, which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars,"" he said.\n\n""These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc have never been successful: they never removed poverty; they just distributed it so that everyone is equally poor.

452,452,"b'Lok Sabha Exit Polls Result: The final phase of the Lok Sabha election, spanning seven phases, concludes on Saturday. Attention now shifts to exit polls, forecasting the potential government composition. However, exit polls are prone to flaws, including faulty premises, tight contest margins, cost-cutting pressures, human sampling errors, reliance on historical data, lack of demographic information, and insufficient representation of women.The final phase of the Lok Sabha election, spanning seven phases, will come to a close on Saturday. Following the conclusion of polling, attention will shift to exit polls, which are expected to forecast the potential composition of the next government. The focus will primarily be on determining whether the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) or the opposition bloc led by Congress, known as INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance), is likely to secure victory.\n\nHowever, exit polls, often eagerly awaited and scrutinized after the completion of election seasons, are not without their flaws. Despite their seemingly scientific methodology, several factors can contribute to inaccuracies in their predictions.\n\n1. Faulty Basic Premise: Exit polls operate under the assumption that voters will truthfully reveal their choices during personal interviews. However, this premise can be faulty. Some individuals may intentionally deceive pollsters, while others, particularly from marginalized or vulnerable communities, may feel pressured to conceal their true opinions.\n\nAdditionally, the setting of exit polls, often conducted just outside voting booths, may influence respondents to provide socially acceptable answers rather than expressing their genuine preferences.\n\n2. Tight Contest: Exit polls typically come with a margin of error ranging from 1% to 3%. In states where electoral battles are closely contested, such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 2018, where the vote share difference was less than 1 percentage point, this margin becomes especially significant.\n\n3. Cost-Cutting and Methodological Pressures: Budget constraints and time limitations can compromise the quality of exit polls. Many media channels operate within tight budgets, impacting the depth of research and data collection. Moreover, the pressure to deliver results promptly can lead to shortcuts in methodology, such as relying on computer-assisted telephone interviews, which may not accurately reflect ground realities.\n\n4. Human Errors in Sampling: Despite technological advancements, human involvement in sampling introduces the possibility of error. Field resources may inadvertently select convenient polling booths, skewing the results, particularly towards urban areas.\n\n5. Reliance on Historical Data: Exit polls often rely on historical election data for analysis. However, in a diverse country like India, with evolving demographics and voting patterns, historical data may not provide an accurate representation of current sentiments. Factors such as population growth, changes in voter lists, and shifts in turnout can complicate predictions.\n\n6. Lack of Caste and Socio-Economic Data: The absence of comprehensive data on caste and socio-economic demographics poses a challenge for accurate polling. The last caste census was conducted in 1934, making it difficult to assess the impact of caste dynamics on electoral outcomes. Similarly, limited information on the economic profiles of voters hampers the predictive accuracy of exit polls.\n\n7. Insufficient Representation of Women: Despite the increasing influence of women voters, exit polls often inadequately represent this demographic. While women constitute nearly half of the population, their sample size in surveys typically ranges from 25% to 30%. This disparity can lead to errors in projecting electoral outcomes, particularly in constituencies where women outnumber men.\n\nIn conclusion, while exit polls serve as valuable tools for gauging public opinion, their reliability is subject to various limitations and challenges. As the nation awaits the results of the latest polls, it remains to be seen which pollster will accurately capture the pulse of the electorate.'"

While the rich-poor divide has been growing globally, a recent study by World Inequality Database says India now has more wealth inequality than it did under British rule.\n\nCongress has flagged the concentration of wealth in some hands and promised, in its manifesto, a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various castes and sub-castes.

Our question to the Prime Minister is whether you will increase this 50 percent limit or not? Will you get the caste census conducted or not?""'"
460,460,"b'PM Modi may have sparked a row by accusing Congress of snatching reservation from OBCs and SC/STs to give it to Muslims, but in Karnataka, which he cited as an example, the issue has dominated multiple elections, including the 2023 assembly polls that Congress won.\n\nIn fact, the action in Karnataka precedes the demand for a caste census by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, which came on the heels of a statewide survey in Bihar.\n\nResponding to the PM\'s criticism, Kharge told TOI: ""While it is popularly being called a caste census, what we are proposing to do is a socioeconomic and educational survey that aims to assess and identify communities eligible for welfare schemes. We\'ve already implemented several schemes like MGNREGA, which aren\'t based on caste but on needs of all communities. Modi is making the issue communal solely for electoral gain.""\n\nKarnataka has been at the forefront of the caste survey issue -- much like with \'guarantees\' this season -- and a report on it was submitted by a commission headed by Jayaprakash Hegde, now Congress candidate from UdupiChikmagalur. The Siddaramaiah govt accepted the report but is yet to implement its recommendations.\n\nCampaign plots of LS polls in Karnataka include the OBC narrative. If Siddaramaiah with his Ahinda credentials is Congress\'s lead actor, BJP has been projecting PM Modi as the OBC face.\n\nShivaraj Thangadagi, Karnataka backward classes welfare minister, told TOI: ""Our govt has done what none had before by accepting the report. Its implementation will not only benefit backward communities but also the party, for sticking to its commitment. The concerns of other communities will be addressed while implementing this.""\n\nUnion home minister Amit Shah and Karnataka leader of opposition R Ashoka have reiterated how BJP was with OBCs with Modi being ""sabse bada (biggest) OBC"" during their campaigns in the state.\n\nNationally, Nitish Kumar -- who had commissioned the Bihar caste survey -- leaving INDIA and Congress being concerned about caste matrices across states may have seen the party use the OBC card cautiously, but it has included it in its national manifesto, while BJP continues to actively woo these communities.\n\n""Congress didn\'t tolerate leaders from extremely backward classes. In 1987, Congress refused to accept Karpoori Thakurji as opposition leader whom we honoured a few days ago with Bharat Ratna. These days, Congress colleagues express concern about the number of people from backward classes in govt, where they\'re positioned... But I\'m surprised they don\'t notice the biggest OBC (referring to himself),"" Modi told Parliament on Feb 5.\n\nThe PM referring to himself as the biggest OBC came close on the heels of Rahul claiming that Modi\'s Teli caste was not part of other backward classes.\n\nNational Scene\n\nIndia\'s first proper caste enumeration was under the British in 1931. Subsequently, while the Constitution addressed education and job reservations for SC/STs, the first independent govt realised there were numerous underprivileged backward commu nities, resulting in the Kaka Kalekar commission in 1953, which recommended a castewise census enumeration in the 1961 Census.\n\nBut it was Mandal Commission\'s 1980 report that proved pivotal, identifying 3,742 OBC communities and recommending 52% quotas -- though only 27% reservations were implemented by V P Singh\'s govt in 1989 amid violent protests and legal battles.\n\nA landmark 1993 Supreme Court judgment (Indira Sawhney case) capped overall reservations at 50% but allowed exceptions. It also introduced the \'creamy layer\' excluded from reservation, based on annual income limits, currently Rs 8 lakh.\n\nKarnataka Pioneers Mysore ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar appointed the Leslie Miller commission to examine non-Brahmin underrepresentation in 1918, despite opposition from then Divan M Visvesvaraya.\n\nPost-Independence, Nagana Gowda Commission (1960) recommended 45% job and 50% education quotas for OBCs, excluding Lingayats, which prevented implementation. Then, the 1975 LG Havanur panel raised the quantum to 32% across the three categories it introduced. But the exclusion of Lingayats again caused friction.\n\nTo address this, the T Venkataswamy commission was formed, which, in its 1986 re port, included some Lingayat sub-castes and, again, the 1990 O Chinnappa Reddy commission included Muslims, Vokkaligas and Lingayats, but the latter two were dissatisfied with the representation. This finally led to creation of a permanent BC commission, with the first in 1994 led by Kudur Narayana Pai.\n\nThe Chinnappa Reddy report recommendation was implemented in 1994-95 and has since been used as the matrix for reservations in the state.\n\nAnd in 2015, CM Siddaramaiah set up the H Kantharaju commission to carry out a socio-economic educational survey, commonly called caste survey. While Siddaramaiah\'s tenure ended before the report could be submitted, leaked contents created heartburn among Vokkaligas and Lingayats. Subsequent govts didn\'t accept the report citing reasons, including a technicality that the membersecretary hadn\'t signed it. This prompted the Jayaprakash Hegde commission to revisit the Kantharaju panel report. The Hegde commission has since submitted its report to the Siddaramaiah govt.\n\nIn between, BJP\'s Basavaraj Bommai govt had in Dec 2022 rejigged the categories based on which existing reservation was being implemented. It removed Muslims and added an additional quota for Vokkaligas and Lingayats. But its implementation is stalled as a case is pending before Supreme Court.'"

""The actual strength and backwardness of communities will be known ,"" he said.\n\nHe said the primary focus of the INDIA bloc was to protect the Constitution, which was the source of strength for SCs, STs, BCS, tribals, minorities and other sections.""The numerical strength of these sections would be 90% of the country\'s population and they deserved reservations as per their numbers.""\n\nHe said,""The entire country is being ruled by people whose population does not exceed 2-3%. When the INDIA bloc forms the govt, real power will be wielded by people whose numbers will become clear when a caste census is undertaken,"" he said.\n\nRahul Gandhi said that they will deposit 1 lakh in the name of a woman in each family belonging to the underprivileged. This would also include poor from sections of society which are considered forward classes. ""Pehli naukri pakki,"" Rahul said as he promised that first job of the youth was guaranteed. Rahul said as many as 30 lakh govt jobs that were not filled by the Narendra Modi govt would be filled. By Aug, he said 2 lakh crop loan waiver would also be taken up.\n\n""We will jumpstart the economy,"" he said while assuring farmers that they would get MSP for their produce.\n\nMNREGA wages will be increased from 250 to 400 and salaries of Asha and Anganwadi workers will be doubled, he said. Chief minister A Revanth Reddy recalled that Rahul Gandhi\'s grandmother Indira Gandhi had got elected from Medak constituency in 1980. He said there was industrial development in Medak because of her. ""She represented the constituency until her last breath when she was assassinated in 1984,"" he reminded.\n\nRevanth urged voters to elect Congress nominee Neelam Madhu and defeat BRS and BJP who have had a grip on the constituency for two decades.'"
462,462,"b'BENGALURU: Although Lok Sabha elections have concluded in Karnataka, parties have little time to rest since a series of important polls are likely to be scheduled over the next six months.\n\nIn fact, the electoral fervour began with assembly elections in April-May last year and with zilla and taluk panchayats elections and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) polls likely to be scheduled later this year, political functionaries will remain on their toes.\n\nElections to these local bodies are long overdue and were postponed for many reasons, resulting in a packed schedule this year. Zilla and taluk panchayat (ZP-TP) polls -- an exercise that is perhaps matched only by assembly polls since they will be held across 31 districts and encompass an electorate of about 4 crore -- have been pending since May 2021, while BBMP council polls were originally due in September 2020. They were first disrupted by the pandemic and later reorganization of constituencies.\n\n""Successive govts evaded ZP-TP and BBMP polls,"" said Tippeswamy, a senior JD(S) functionary. ""It appears the time has arrived since the current administration cannot avoid its constitutional duty of conducting elections to these local bodies.""\n\nIn Jan, the state govt told the high court that it will fulfil all necessary procedures to conduct these elections within a month. The court was hearing a petition filed by the Karnataka State Election Com mission (SEC).\n\nKey processes involve delimitation of constituencies and notification of constituency-wise reservation. SEC has already compiled electoral rolls, with arrangements underway for a final round of revision.\n\nWhile the delimitation exercise for both ZP-TP constituencies and BBMP wards has been completed, the govt is yet to finalise reservation. In Sept last year, the urban development department reduced BBMP wards from 243 to 225 through a notification. Delimitation for zilla panchayats, comprising 1,101 constituencies, and taluk panchayats (3,621 seats), was carried out in Nov 2023.\n\nQuota conundrum\n\nPriyank Kharge, minister for panchayat raj and rural development, said: ""We are not avoiding ZP-TP polls. They will be conducted soon.""\n\nYet, this determination does not mirror action on the ground in terms of finalising reservation. This, despite the govt accepting the Justice K Bhaktavatsala Commission report, which recommends 33% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local bodies. Officials suggest the govt is likely to address this issue in the next cabinet meeting -- when it is also likely to discuss the caste census report submitted by the K Jayaprakash Hegde Commission.\n\n""The state govt has not fulfilled its commitment to the HC regarding reservation. We will petition the court to instruct the govt,"" said S Basavaraj, SEC commissioner.\n\nCouncil polls first up\n\nMeanwhile, in June, Karnataka will also witness elections to 17 seats in the legislative council. These elections have been necessitated due to retirements and resignations of members from various constituencies, including teachers\', graduates\', local bodies, and the legislative assembly.\n\n""Council polls are significant since they can alter party standings. We are confident of securing a majority, as we anticipate winning eight of the 11 seats allocated from the assembly quota,"" said Saleem Ahmed, Congress chief whip in the council. ""We are also optimistic about winning all six seats from teachers\' and graduates\' constituencies.""'"

Every sub-caste of BC should get an opportunity to represent their community in the elected bodies. The Congress govt should not force us to campaign against it by conducting local body elections without enhancing the BC quota and categorising them into A, B, C and D groups,"" he said.\n\nTelangana State BC Commission chairman Krishna Mohan Vakulabharanam told TOI that the exercise to issue a notification to consult all the stakeholders and conduct a door-to-door survey could begin only after the Lok Sabha poll model code ends.\n\nAnother hitch in conducting the election in June-end or July is Congress\'s promise made during Nov 2023 assembly elections that it will enhance the BC quota from 22 per cent to 42 per cent in local bodies. Giving 42 per cent quota to BCs will result in crossing the 50 per cent fixed by the apex court on overall quota, as SCs and STs and minorities are already getting the reservations, an expert pointed out. On the other hand, AICC leader Rahul Gandhi has promised a BC caste census based on which the BC quota will be increased to above 50 per cent in tune with their population.\n\nPolitical experts said even if the dedicated state BC commission completes the survey to know the political representation of BCs in rural elected bodies with the help of panchayat raj, rural development and other departments, the Supreme Court directive not to exceed 50 per cent overall quota cap cannot be breached unless an amendment is made to the relevant sections of the Constitution in Parliament.'"
464,464,"b'Bengaluru: As the state govt gears up to resume administrative activities Monday following a two-month hiatus during the Lok Sabha polls, it faces a host of challenges. Drought relief, employee pay hikes, and the contentious issue of a caste census are among the pressing matters confronting the chief minister Siddaramaiah-led administration.\n\nDespite the completion of polling in Karnataka, the model code of conduct remains in effect until June 1, owing to the upcoming phases of polling in other states.The model code will be in force also because of polls for the legislative council from teachers and graduates constituencies slated for June 3. In light of this, the CM has called an informal meeting Monday to discuss these issues. He arrived in Bengaluru Friday after taking a break at a resort in Ooty.\n\nAn urgent task facing the state govt is the distribution of drought-relief funds received from the Centre. After a prolonged dispute with the Union govt, Karnataka secured Rs 3,454 crore in drought relief. However, the challenge now lies in dispersing this amount among the distressed farmers in accordance with National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) guidelines. These guidelines stipulate Rs 8,500 per hectare for rain-fed areas and Rs 18,000 per hectare for irrigated lands as input subsidies for crop loss. Despite the allocation from the Centre, the funds are deemed inadequate, considering the state govt\'s original request for Rs 18,174 crore. Officials, however, said they have already started disbursing relief to beneficiaries.\n\n""We have ensured that all eligible farmers receive the input subsidy, although the amount of funds released by the Centre does not match the actual requirement. So far, 35.8 lakh farmers have received the input subsidy,"" said finance secretary LK Atheeq, who is also additional chief secretary to the chief minister.\n\nGranting gratuitous relief (GR) for the loss of livelihood poses another major hurdle, with the officials indicating that the state govt will once again appeal to the Centre for additional funds to address this issue.\n\nThe task of increasing employee salaries as per the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission presents another formidable challenge. The panel submitted its report in March and its recommendation of a 27.5% salary hike translates to an additional cost of Rs 17,440 crore. However, the budget presented by Siddaramaiah in Feb allocated Rs 80,003 crore for salaries, up from Rs 65,003 crore in the previous fiscal year.\n\nThis creates a shortfall of at least Rs 2,440 crore if the govt decides to implement the commission\'s recommendations.\n\nFull report: toi.in'"

467,467,"b'The 18th Lok Sabha elections spark a debate on inequality as Congress proposes a caste census countered by BJP. The Supreme Court reinterprets Article 39(b) to address wealth distribution and wealth inequality in India. Parliament may enact a wealth tax based on a study by the World Inequality Database.Amid polls to constitute the 18th Lok Sabha, the governing party and the opposition have clashed over a critical question -- how much inequality is India willing to tolerate? In its manifesto, Congress has promised to conduct a nationwide caste census to determine the socio-economic conditions of various caste and sub-caste groups. Congress functionaries have taken umbrage to the unfair concentration of wealth in the hands of a select few individuals.BJP has hit back, accusing Congress of appeasement politics and termed this exercise an attempt to extract private wealth from individuals and redistribute it among minorities.\n\nThe issue is philosophical: to whom do a country\'s material resources belong? As this debate rages on in election rallies and across TV newsrooms, the Supreme Court is quietly preparing to answer this question. While deciding a seemingly innocuous set of property disputes originally filed in 1992, the SC has felt the need to re-interpret Article 39(b) of the Constitution, a directive principle of state policy which urges the state to make policies to ensure ""that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as to best subserve the common good"".\n\nNot just an academic question\n\nGenerally, directive principles of state policy are unenforceable by a court of law. A member of the Constituent Assembly even described the entire part as a \'dustbin of sentiment\'. But Article 39(b) is different. It is underwritten by Article 31C -- which provides that a law made by Parliament in furtherance of Article 39(b) is not invalid even if it violates fundamental rights such as equality and freedom of trade. It is worth mentioning that the linkage between the two provisions is also an issue before the Supreme Court in this very case.\n\nThe trajectory of the case\n\nOf course, the expression \'material resources\' must include public resources. The question is simple: does it include private resources as well?\n\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\nA recent study by the World Inequality Database has stated that wealth inequality in India is now higher than what it was during British rule in India. In light of this, Parliament could potentially enact a \'wealth tax\' where all citizens with a certain net worth would be taxed 2% of their wealth. Challenging the law because it violates fundamental rights such as equality, life and personal liberty, and freedom of trade would be futile, because Article 39(b), backed up by Article 31C, would kick in.\n\nAnother example includes a law to acquire all privately held forest land across the country and distribute it among tribal communities who are displaced by climate change, infrastructure projects, internal conflict etc. A mere reference in such an Act to Article 39(b) will save it from being struck down.\n\nThe real implications\n\nThe implications of this case go beyond the immediate political debate. Its significance lies in how the apex court interprets the constitutional guarantee of equality, and how much power it gives to the state to fulfil this guarantee. A restrictive interpre tation will assign the role of reducing inequality to the private market, hoping that \'invisible hand\' will reach everyone. A broader interpretation will give greater powers to the state to interfere in private affairs to ensure proper redistribution of wealth.\n\nUnderlying this provision is an assumption that the state may be better capable of ensuring equality. This may be true in some cases, but very false in others.\n\nA Gandhian vision of Article 39(b)\n\nDuring the hearings, CJI Chandrachud stated that Article 39(b) could not be interpreted in a purely communist or socialist sense. He seemed to detect a Gandhian flavour to the provision.\n\nIt is hence likely that the SC will give us a more nuanced interpretation of Article 39(b). Private property may not be wholly excluded, but certain kinds of private property may be declared to be held in trust.\n\nThe authors are with the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy'"

Samajwadi Party has been the only exception when in 1998 its candidate Mukhtar Anees recorded a victory.\n\nAlso, in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections, four out of five assembly segments namely - Sitapur, Biswan, Sewata and Mahmudabad-went to the BJP while only Laharpur was won by the SP. In the current election, three of the five segments are believed to be harbouring anti-BJP sentiments.\n\nThe triangular contest passes through a labyrinth of caste, local issues, and anti-incumbency. With a significant presence of OBC voters, analysts say that reflections of the ongoing national debate on reservation and caste census are sure to find mention here. Analysts said OBCs form 40-45% of the total electorate in Uttar Pradesh and may play a key role in deciding the winners in 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\n\n""Sitapur seat presents a case in point when it comes to the scramble for OBC votes in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.

471,471,"b'Rajya Sabha member and Congress minority affairs chief, 36-year-old poet and party spokesperson Imran Pratapgarhi tells TOI that campaign language matters, how Congress pulled back the campaign to issues, and that \'polarising\' speech has run its course. Edited excerpts:What is this \'s biggest issue?\n\nBJP\'s Pramod Krishnam has loudly and publicly announced caste-based reservations will be terminated. What Anant Hegde, Jyoti Mirdha, Lallu Singh or BJP\'s posterboy Arun Govil earlier said on campaign trail - that give BJP a large majority so it can change the Constitution. Their seniors\' silence shows their support. People have to decide if they have to save the govt, or, save Ambedkar\'s Constitution.\n\nWhat media shows is far from ground reality.Jobs, Agniveer, inflation, women\'s safety, caste census are big issues. Congress manifesto is subject of in-depth discussion among people. There\'s desperation in BJP, and it will reflect in their speeches.\n\nBut BJP is presumed to be winning its third LS term.\n\nThere\'s no consensus BJP\'s winning. Two phases of voting are over. People have shown their anger against govt. Many BJP candidates and MPs have refused to contest elections: Gautam Gambhir, Jayant Sinha, VK Singh, Birender Singh. Attempts to create an atmosphere for \'400 seats\' failed. I\'ve been to Kerala, UP, Uttarakhand, Thar, J&K, Karnataka, Maharashtra. BJP\'s losing on seats it considered safe - like Udhampur, Chandrapur (Maha). Even Nagpur was a tough fight. This is the mood on the ground. INDIA\'s got a tremendous boost.\n\nSo your campaign will stick to people\'s issues?\n\nBJP has no achievement to show for 10 years in office. That is this govt\'s biggest failure. Congress as a secular party speaks about \'hissedari\' and social justice, jobs, women\'s empowerment. Despite defeats in two elections, Rahul Gandhi has stuck to people\'s and country\'s issues. He is a stubborn politician. It is Rahul\'s victory that Congress manifesto has forced BJP veterans on the backfoot. We pulled this election back to issues, which was a big defeat for them.\n\nMany Congress seniors have joined BJP. That must hurt.\n\nI make a distinction between those who leave Congress of their own will, and those who\'re forced to join BJP. But it\'s a victory of the Nehruvian school of thought that despite a decade in power, BJP could not establish its own leadership that is intellectually and politically strong.\n\nThey\'ve had to take the Ashok Chavans and Milind Deoras, and drop their own ideological flag bearers like Sadhvi Pragya, Pratap Simha, Anand Hegde. But it has made no dent to Congress. Seniors have left but not the people. Shiv Sena and NCP split up, but situation is such that BJP had to drop Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar as star campaigners.\n\nDo you find yourself doubly vulnerable?\n\nYou run that risk, you have to face it. In Parliament, a BJP MP hurled an innuendo by talking about a neighbouring country\'s prime minister, and I said, ""Main Bharat ka Imran hun."" This demolishes their campaign against me. The situation is dangerous. Statements like ""identifying people by their clothes"" and the silence on acts of hatred, matter. But that ploy, tried even today, has run its course. Hatred has a shelf life.\n\nOne Bharat Jodo Yatra was enough to demolish BJP\'s caricature of Rahul Gandhi. What is BJP\'s USP if it doesn\'t fire from the Muslim\'s shoulders? Fear is always there, but you have to face it.\n\nAre the crowds for the poet or the Congress campaigner?\n\nI\'m a Rajya Sabha member, and as head of Congress\'s minority department, I connect communities of Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Bauddh, Christians and Muslims with Congress organisationally. As a star campaigner, I amplify Congress\'s commitments. I use poetic language, my trade, to connect with people. When in Banihal, Ghulam Nabi\'s home, I said politicians ""apne bangle bachane ke liye tumhare khwabon ke gharonde bech diye"" (to save their bungalows, they sold your dreams), the gathering concurred. When you frame issues in poetry, people connect.\n\nAre rally crowds converting into votes for Congress?\n\nI have a personal fan base and Congress has an organisation and workers. It\'s a double advantage. I try to convince audiences on social issues, which are also central ideas of my poetry. I\'ve never done shayari of \'zulfo-shaam\' (adulatory/ romantic). I have spoken about farmers\' issues, lynching, about Najeeb, Pehlu Khan. So, my political speeches tie in with my poetry. It is a plus for the party.'"

He promises education, healthcare reforms, and job creation, advocating for marginalized communities and attacking the BJP\'s track record on unemployment and poverty.Describing sitting MP from Lucknow Rajnath Singh as an ""outsider"", Samajwadi Party and India bloc candidate Ravidas Mehrotra said that Lucknow needs a representative who lives among them round the clock. In an interview with Mohita Tewari, he highlights his promises and shares his vision for the development of Lucknow. Excerpts:\n\nYou are already an MLA from Lucknow Central and now contesting for Lok Sabha.What made you jump into the fray?\n\nI am an ordinary party worker, and I am contesting on the direction of SP president Akhilesh Yadav. I have always been with the people of Lucknow in their good and bad times for last 50 years. I started as vice-president of the students\' union of Shri Jai Narain Misra Postgraduate College. I was part of the JP movement during the Emergency and went to jail for 20 months.\n\nYou are contesting against BJP veteran Rajnath Singh who is eyeing a hat-trick from Lucknow Lok Sabha seat, which has been a BJP bastion since 1991. What is your strategy against him?\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Congress and SP lost because their candidates were outsiders. This time I am in the fray, and I belong to Lucknow. Our present MP is also an outsider. He is also our defence minister who brought the Agniveer scheme in defence services that retires a young soldier in his 20s after four years of service. Is it fair? The present MP is not concerned about real problems and issues of the people. He was absent during Covid-19 pandemic. Lucknow needs a representative who lives with the people round the clock. Further, the BJP-led NDA govt has not opened a single manufacturing unit in the city. Instead, it has sold some stocks of Hindustan Aeronautic Limited to the private sector.\n\nSP and Congress joined hands in 2017 assembly elections but the alliance didn\'t click. You lost from Lucknow Central because a Congress rebel contested against you? Will the alliance work this time?\n\nIssues are different in assembly and Lok Sabha elections. Since 2017, Bharatiya Janata Party has been both at the Centre and in the state. Unemployment and poverty have increased manifold. Akhilesh ji and Rahul ji are now fighting together to save the Constitution. They have joined hands to provide more jobs and improve the financial status of the people. The BJP-led NDA govt has been working only for industrialists and oppressing opposition by misusing govt agencies.\n\nWill party president Akhilesh Yadav focus on PDA work in elections?\n\nWhile \'P\' is for \'pichdda\' (backward) and \'D\' stands for Dalits, \'A\' refers both to \'alpsankhyak\' (minorities) and \'agda\' (economically weaker and women among upper castes). The focus is on the uplift of the status of all by conducting socio-economic caste census. For this, if required, reservation limits in jobs and education will be lifted to bring deprived people into the mainstream. India bloc has also promised to fill 30 lakh vacant govt posts.\n\nYou hold a Limca book record for going to jail for about 250 times. Don\'t you think this puts you in a negative light?\n\nI have been jailed 250 times, but not for criminal activities, but for holding protests, fasts and holding demonstrations to help people get justice. Already, 232 cases against me have been expunged by the court.\n\nIf elected, what will you do for the people of Lucknow?\n\nI will ensure every residential colony will have a govt school with teaching at par with private schools, a govt hospital with free services and Rs 8,500 per month pension to poor women.\n\nThis will be the first election after the demise of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Your comments.\n\nThe vacuum left by \'Netaji\' can never be filled.

The Congress stand that BRS and BJP have entered into a secret understanding has been vindicated with BRS former minister Ch Malla Reddy openly supporting BJP\'s Eatala Rajender in Malkajgiri constituency. Even Eatala, party leaders G Kishan Reddy and Bandi Sanjay were not saying that reservations will not be scrapped, he said.\n\n""BRS-BJP secret deal is exposed in the fact that the BRS has not taken action against Malla Reddy.

""We are only demanding that the survey should be done in a scientific manner to assess the population accurately. In that sense, the manifesto of Congress is on the right track as it promises to conduct the survey afresh at the national level. But the party must convey this message properly if it wants the support of Lingayats in these elections.""\n\nChief minister Siddaramaiah commissioned the caste census during his previous term in 2015 and Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, headed by H Kantharaju was entrusted with the job.

However, Rahul mistakenly stated in Nirmal that the Congress govt in Telangana is already providing 2,500 monthly pension to women as part of a scheme.

While Modi has pushed the youth of the country into unemployment trap, the Congress was guaranteeing an apprenticeship (job) of one year to graduates and diploma holders, he said. While Modi govt did not waive off crop loans of poor farmers, it waived off loans of its corporate friends, Rahul said, adding that a Congress govt will instead make crores of women lakhpatis. The Congress will also enhance daily wages under MNREGA from \'250 to \'400 per day and double the income of ASHA and Anganwadi employees, he said.\n\n""The Congress will remove contract job system and give regular jobs in govt sector.

MORE\n\nThe nation is witnessing immense debate on some of the inclusions in the Congress manifesto and the Prime Minister\'s scathing comments on the same. Sam Pitroda, Rahul Gandhi\'s mentor in USA, added fuel to fire by supporting the idea of wealth redistribution and suggesting the implementation of an inheritance tax on the assets left behind.\n\nIntroduction of the Congress party manifesto says \'Inequality between the rich on the one hand and the poor and middle classes on the other have increased sharply dealing a body blow to the goals of equality, equity, and social and economic justice. The rise of inequality has been particularly pronounced between 2014 and 2023\'. The section of the manifesto in the eye of the storm includes the following:\n\nRahul Gandhi has asked the question ""shouldn\'t we aspire for a society that is representative in the rewards and the benefits as per identity?"" This is where the Congress fails in its understanding of state\'s responsibilities towards the welfare of the nation\'s less fortunate citizens.\n\nHow can rewards and benefits be a function of one\'s identity? When related to governance, a benefit implies aid, assistance and welfare of the citizens to reach the goal of minimum acceptable standard of life. A reward, on the other hand, is related to compensation, recognition, bonus and premium in recognition of a citizen\'s efforts, enterprise and ingenuity to create wealth for the nation. A reward has to be earned and the result is directly proportional to one\'s efforts while a benefit through government action may accrue to an individual without any matching efforts. Benefit is targeted towards the pursuit of the goal of minimum acceptable standard of life. For the enterprising rewards have no limit but benefits for the needy will always be limited. This differentiation also explains why there is vast difference of wealth held by individuals in a society - a universal phenomenon that was true in the past and continues to be so today.\n\nDisbursement of benefits has to be need based and carried out without any identity bias based on religion, caste, colour or any other trait. Benefits must never be seen as a dole for an entire community or a section of the society. They have to be strictly need-based for individuals.\n\nA government can dispense benefits only if it first creates wealth for such work. This wealth comes mainly in the form of taxes from those who earn rewards and through judicious management and exploitation of the natural resources of the nation. Prudent and smart governments have to play a balancing game when levying taxes on rewards. While there is a need to maximise the kitty, they also have to ensure that wealth generators do not get demotivated to create more wealth. It goes without saying that if no wealth is created, there will be no inflow of wealth through taxes. History is replete with examples of extreme forms of socialistic governments that only focussed on redistribution of wealth and ignored this simple logic. The end results were disastrous, to say the least.\n\nIn one of his election speeches, Rahul Gandhi said, \'the most important guarantee was of caste census, which will be an X-ray of the socio-economic conditions in the country. Right now, there are gross disparities in the distribution of power, wealth and resources in the country. Once the Congress forms government, a caste census followed by a financial and institutional survey will be carried out for equal distribution of resources in the country.\'\n\nThe truth is that not every Dalit, ST/SC, OBC or an individual from any particular religious community is poor. Some have advanced in life and reached great heights. The same is true for other citizens of the nation also who do not fall in such categories. Are all Brahmins wealthy? One will have to be very na\xc3\xafve, and mischievous in intent, to answer this in the affirmative. One can argue on the percentage of poor and well to do among different sections of the society but any collective categorisation will always be faulty. In the end, just as the benefits must flow to all without any bias, the government\'s kitty for benefit disbursal will also have to be funded by all who are wealthy irrespective of their category or religion.\n\nReportedly, Rahul Gandhi has also said that \'we will do a caste census so that the backwards, SCs, STs, poor of general castes and minorities get to know how much they account for in the country. After that, we will do a financial and institutional survey to find who holds the country\'s wealth, what section holds it, and then we will undertake revolutionary work. Whatever is your right, we will work on giving you the same. Be it media, bureaucracy, or all institutions -- we will create space for you there and give you your right.\'\n\nAny survey/ census to ascertain who is poor and needs benefits is welcome as long as it is fair and universal. But any assertions that they have a right to wealth, power and national resources in the same percentage is neither practical nor feasible. Such policies will always be detrimental to future wealth creation in the country. Wealth and power distribution disparity is a given in any society. The aim has to be to ensure a minimum standard of life for every citizen through suitable benefits but any efforts to equalise the wealth holdings among all citizens will be catastrophic.\n\nThe above inclusions in Congress party\'s manifesto and Rahul\'s utterings on the same are not only wrong in principle but also in intent. In its desperation it is obvious the Congress is now veering towards another extreme in the form of wealth equalisation and increasing reservations to lure voters. Unfortunately, such gallimaufry resonates well with a large section of voters. Given the compulsions of the election season, surely a strong reaction from the Prime Minister and his party was expected. However, the Prime Minister could certainly have been a bit more circumspect in some of his statements.'"

The seminar is being jointly held by the Samruddha Bharat Foundation and All India Backward Classes Federation, Social Revolution Alliance, Justice V Eswaraiah and others.\n\nThe conclave aims at urging the ruling government to protect the Constitution and adhere to its principles, with emphasis on social justice.The event will feature four sessions, culminating in a valedictory address by Gandhi. His recent focus on social justice issues and the advocacy for a caste census have positioned him as a key speaker for the seminar. ""Despite landmark judgments like Indra Sawhney & Others vs Union of India, in contemporary India, the rich are becoming richer and the poor poorer. There has been little upliftment and protection of backward communities. They must be represented in every sphere of life, from economics to politics. The main objectives include honouring the Construction of India and its people, implementing the fundamental rights, achieve the directive principles, protect the federal structure of democracy, stop privatisation and conduct socio-economic caste census to give them their due share in all state wings,"" said Justice V Eswariah, who will be the keynote speaker.\n\nThe seminar is expected to highlight the need for social justice and equal representation, aligning with Gandhi\'s agenda of addressing these critical issues. tnn'"

Indira Gandhi divided Pakistan into two pieces and established Bangladesh as a separate nation, what did you do?""\n\n""Modi has been spreading lies about Congress like it will remove mangalsutra of women, snatch half land, if somebody has two buffaloes one will be given to Muslims, etc. even after sitting at a reputed post like of Prime Minister.

Modi never speaks about farmers who died during 13 months long protests against black agriculture laws.

Modi Ji and his disciple CM here is not giving these jobs, as a large number of them would go to Dalits and deprived classes, therefore, they stopped giving jobs. They started a new system Agniveer scheme for recruiting youth in armed forces for four years, who would later roam free. If they had done (regular) recruitment in the military, the youth would have got permanent jobs on vacancies.

Kharge said BJP has no right to seek vote from people as it did not even keep prices of general commodities in control.\n\nKharge underlined promises made in Congress manifesto, like waiving farmers\' loan, MSP guarantee, removing GST from agriculture, implementation of Swaminathan C2+50 formula for deciding crop prices and payment of crop loss insurance within 20 days.\n\nCarrying a copy of the Constitution of India in his hand and showing it to the public, Kharge said, ""We and Rahul Gandhi Ji are fighting to save the Constitution.

Congress had managed to win only 19 seats, while BJP had lost deposits in 100 constituencies. However, the stunning victory of BJP from four Lok Sabha constituencies in 2019, including two BC candidates, and three by Congress (all three Reddys) as against nine by BRS, revealed that the BC vote bank was divided between the three principal parties in various constituencies in the 2019 general election.\n\nIn the 2023 assembly polls, Congress had won 64 seats and could not have done it without the support of BCs, in addition to voters from other communities. This means that a majority of BC voters in rural areas shifted their support from BRS to Congress in the 2023 polls.\n\nFor the May 13 election, BJP MP from Karimnagar Bandi Sanjay is facing two candidates from the influential Velama community in Karimnagar district, V Rajender Rao of Congress and ex-MP B Vinod Kumar of BRS. BJP MP from Nizamabad Dharmapuri Arvind, who defeated K Kavitha of BRS in 2019, is pitted against MLC T Jeevan Reddy of Congress and a BC leader and ex-MLA Bajireddy Goverdhan of BRS.\n\nBJP strongman Eatala Rajender has entered the electoral from India's largest constituency in terms of voters, Malkajgiri.

Nilam Madhu of Congress from Medak, B Narsaiah Goud of BJP from Bhongir, T Padma Rao Goud of BRS in Secunderabad, Kasani Gnaneshwar of BRS in Chevella are all from BC community and face formidable Reddy and other community candidates in their respective constituencies."""

504,504,"b'India\'s opposition political alliance has vowed to conduct the first nationwide census of caste groups in nearly a century if elected, in a controversial attempt to galvanise marginalised voters it argues have been left behind by Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata party.\n\nModi has dominated India\'s politics for a decade in part by wooing voters across castes, presenting his party as a unifier of Hindus while stoking mistrust of India\'s large Muslim minority.\n\nBut his rivals argue that this has obscured deepening hardship and joblessness among lower-caste Indians. The opposition, a loose alliance of parties known as INDIA, has promised to hold a socio-economic caste census and increase affirmative action and benefits for disadvantaged groups if elected in India\'s six-week polls, which end on June 1.\n\nTheir campaign builds off a count conducted last year in the vast northern state of Bihar, one of the poorest and most populous. It revealed that lower castes made up a large majority of the state\'s population of 130mn and were among its most deprived despite decades of government policies aimed at redressing caste inequalities.\n\n""This is our new revolutionary mission,"" Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the opposition Indian National Congress, told supporters last month.\n\nAnalysts said the opposition hoped to win over lower-caste voters, who, if the Bihar census is a representative measure, may make up a greater share of India\'s 1.4bn population than officially acknowledged.\n\n""This nation is brutally divided on caste, and people who have the privilege of being in the upper caste are not willing to jettison it,"" said Manoj Jha, an MP from Congress\'s Bihar-based ally the Rashtriya Janata Dal. ""This caste survey is going to change the grammar forever.""\n\nIndia\'s ancient social hierarchy ranges from the priestly Brahmin caste to Dalits, formerly known as untouchables and now categorised as ""scheduled castes"". Other strata in between represent merchants, farmers and labourers.\n\nIndia has sought to abolish caste discrimination by reserving quotas in government jobs and universities for Dalits and later for ""other backward classes"".\n\nBut until the Bihar survey, authorities had shied away from counting castes out of fear of sparking political upheaval, with the last nationwide data on castes released in 1931. The survey revealed that lower castes, who made up more than 80 per cent of the state\'s population, were disproportionately poor, with nearly half of Dalit families living below the poverty line, compared with a quarter for upper castes.\n\n""The BJP has really succeeded in capturing significant [lower-caste] votes, particularly under Modi,"" said Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""The Congress feels that by making this demand it can claw them back to their side.""\n\nAnalysts cautioned however that the opposition could struggle to convince voters on the merits of a nationwide caste census.\n\nThe BJP\'s rivals ""are doing casteism"", said Kumari Saniya, a 21-year-old engineering student from a privileged caste in Patna, the capital of Bihar, and a supporter of the ruling party. ""If you divide people on the basis of caste, that triggers fights among people.""\n\nModi, the lower-caste head of a traditionally upper-caste party, has sought to present himself as a leader who rises above the divisions of caste to serve India\'s poor. ""Since 2014 when Narendra Modi became prime minister, caste-based politics has been cleaned out,"" said Danish Eqbal, a BJP spokesperson in Bihar.\n\nThe prime minister has boosted welfare spending for the poor, such as through cash transfers and free food schemes. He has in recent days lashed out at Congress, portraying its calls for a caste census as part of a ""hidden agenda"" to divide Hindus and have their wealth and benefits ""snatched away and given to Muslims"".\n\nRonojoy Sen at the National University of Singapore said there appeared to be ""unease within the BJP ranks on whether this insistent demand on a caste census could potentially take away some voters"", though he added that a return to power would be ""an extremely difficult, uphill task for the Congress"".\n\nSonu Kumar Yadav, a 24-year-old Patna resident from a lower caste and an INDIA supporter, said he was forced by abandon his studies and work as a driver to make money. ""Modi made a lot of promises but nothing happened,"" he said. ""Mere talking doesn\'t help.""\n\nPolitical scientists argued that the BJP had been just as attuned to caste politics as its rivals. ""The BJP is a party that has had a very resilient upper caste block around it,"" said Pavithra Suryanarayan, assistant professor of government at the London School of Economics. ""It has been trying to grow that block under a muscular, Hindutva [Hindu nationalist], upper-caste alliance.""\n\nCritics said the BJP\'s claims to overlook caste ignored the insidious role the system continues to play in modern India. While overt segregation -- including ""untouchability"" -- is outlawed, the inequity of caste is often apparent, even in the layout of Bihar\'s villages.\n\nDifferent castes live in separate streets in Parsa Bazar, a village on Patna\'s outskirts, with the multistorey brick houses of more prosperous groups giving way to the dilapidated lanes lacking toilets, home to Dalits.\n\nNishant Kumar, a 28-year-old Dalit, is studying for entry to Bihar\'s civil service through a quota. He has been told by his upper-caste ex-girlfriend that her father would never support their marriage.\n\n""If you ask upper castes, they say there should be no caste-based reservations,"" he said. ""As long as there\'s discrimination on the basis of caste, reservations must continue.""\n\nOthers said addressing caste inequity would require more than affirmative policies alone. Baleshwar Majhi, a 65-year-old Dalit, said benefits such as government jobs were only accessible to those with connections or money for bribes. Whichever party triumphs next month, that reality will not change, he added.\n\n""Reservations don\'t help,"" he said. ""The benefits don\'t reach the poor.""'"

He says we will steal your wealth and give it to those who have more children. Poor people always have more children.

""Poor people have (more) children as they do not have wealth. But why do you (Modi) only keep talking about Muslims?

509,509,"b'The Congress manifesto promises an increase of wages under MGNREGA to Rs 400 per day from Rs 289 currently.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi has built his 2024 Lok Sabha election campaign around \'Nyay\', roughly translated into Justice.\n\n""Since 1926, the Congress Party\'s Manifesto has stood as a testament to trust and commitment,"" the Congress tweeted while mentioning the party\'s ""five Nyay pillars: Yuva Nyay, Nari Nyay, Kisan Nyay, Shramik Nyay and Hissedari Nyay.\n\nGandhi\'s grand promises include giving a legal guarantee to the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) announced by the government every year as recommended by the Swaminathan Commission, launching a Mahalakshmi Scheme to provide Rs 1 lakh per year to every poor Indian family as unconditional cash transfer, increasing wage under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) to Rs 400 per day, guaranteeing a national minimum wage of Rs 400 per day, increasing pension under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs 200-Rs 500 per month to Rs 1,000, and writing off student loans. Moneycontrol spoke to a slew of development and macroeconomists to get a sense of fiscal and administrative challenges that the Congress party will have to confront to make the promises a reality if it is elected to power. There is much difference between campaigning and governance or promises and delivery, they said.\n\nTake, for instance, the promise of increasing pension under the National Social Assistance Programme from Rs 200-Rs 500 per month to Rs 1,000 per month. According to government data, between 2017 and 2021 on average 2.83 crore beneficiaries were covered annually, while combined central and state schemes covered 4.65 crore beneficiaries annually during the period. This alone could cost Rs 40,000 crore per annum, nearly double the current cost.\n\nA senior economist, on the condition of anonymity, said, ""Suffice it to say that these will require significant fiscal effort and sometimes out-of-the-box policymaking to prevent a full-blown fiscal blowout.""\n\nMahalakshmi scheme\n\nThe Congress\' Mahalakshmi scheme, which promises Rs 1 lakh to the oldest living woman member of a poor family and in case there isn\'t the oldest woman member then to the senior-most member of the family, could cost the exchequer between Rs 2 lakh crore and Rs 5 lakh crore.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Socio Economic and Caste Census, there are 24.49 crore (243.9 million) households in India, of which 17.97 crore live in villages. Of these, 10.74 crore households are considered as deprived. Of these 2.38 crore (13.28 percent) households have one or less room, kuccha walls and kuccha roof, 65.33 lakh households (3.64 percent) have no adult member between the age 16 and 59, 69.43 lakh (3.86 percent) are female-headed households with no adult male member between 16 and 59 and 7.20 lakh (0.40 percent) are households with differently abled member and no other able bodied adult member. According to the Census, of the deprived households 3.87 crore (21.56 percent) are SC/ST households, 4.22 crore (23.52 percent) are households with no literate adult above age 25 years and 5.40 crore (30.04 percent) are landless households deriving a major part of their income from manual labour.\n\nIf the Congress party decides to spread the Mahalakshmi scheme over five years, it will have to give Rs 1 lakh to at least 2.148 crore families in one year, this is according to the 2011 Census data. The amount will vary depending on the number of \'poor families\' identified.\n\nA conservative estimate puts the government expenditure at Rs 2.1 lakh crore per annum for the scheme of making unconditional cash transfers. This figure could go up to Rs 5 lakh crore depending on the number of poor families.\n\nAlso Read | Congress\' Mahalakshmi cash transfer scheme could cost between Rs 2 lakh crore and Rs 5 lakh crore\n\nHealth workers\' pay\n\nThe manifesto has also promised to double the pay of frontline health workers such as ASHA workers, which would cost Rs 10,000 crore, according to rough estimates.\n\nAccording to the annual ASHA update of 2020-21, India has 9.83 lakh ASHA workers against the target of 10.35 lakh across 35 states and Union Territories (except Goa and Chandigarh), making it the world\'s largest community volunteer programme. ASHA workers receive performance based compensation and are categorised as volunteers with no legal obligation to the Centre or states to pay them. ASHAs earn money through incentives by delivering 60 tasks set under the National Health Mission. The states set the incentives for ASHAs, which range from Rs 1 to Rs 5,000. Some states offer a fixed amount, over and above the incentives. Earnings of ASHA workers vary across states -- a worker in West Bengal gets a salary of Rs 4,500 plus an incentive from the Centre of up to Rs 1,500. In Rajasthan, ASHA workers received a Rs 2,790 honorarium in 2021.\n\nThe Congress party has promised to guarantee MSP and implement the Swaminathan formula. Under the formula, the MSP is to be calculated as the cost of production plus 50 percent of the cost of production - which the farmers have been demanding and the government has been resisting.\n\nA senior economist pegged the cost of expanding MSP or guaranteeing MSP between Rs 5 lakh crore and Rs 8 lakh crore.\n\nThe Congress manifesto promises an increase of wages under MGNREGA to Rs 400 per day from Rs 289 currently. This could add Rs 25,000 crore to the MGNREGA bill. The Centre had allocated Rs 86,000 crore for MGNREGA for FY24-25.\n\n""It\'s an expensive wishlist,"" quipped a senior bureaucrat.\n\nFor context, India\'s defence allocation was about Rs 6 lakh crore in the interim Budget, while education spend was Rs 1.12 lakh crore and health Rs 86,175 crore for 2023-24.\n\nLekha Chakraborty, Professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said, ""The administrative hurdles will include the digital divide.

""It is the worst manifesto which is not in the interest of the nation,"" Sitharaman said.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with select journalists in Pune, the finance minister wondered whether the Congress has conducted the necessary financial planning to fulfil the assurances listed in its manifesto. ""I know they are not coming to power, but I would still like to ask, even if the subject of the Congress manifesto were to be implemented, has the Congress done the homework on the expenditure required to fulfil the promises listed in the manifesto?"" she asked.\n\nCiting the case of Congress-ruled Karnataka, Sitharaman said they (Congress) attempted to implement the promises made during the state polls despite knowing that they had no funds. ""The deputy chief minister (of Karnataka) publicly acknowledged that they were left with no funds for development as the money was spent on fulfilling five promises made during elections,"" she said.\n\n""This is just about one state. If similar measures (in Congress\' poll manifesto) were to be implemented across the country, the economy, currently ranked among the top five globally and projected to rise to the third position in the next couple of years, would regress into the \'fragile five\',"" the finance minister said. It is the BJP\'s duty towards the nation to question the poll document of the Congress.\n\nNotably, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused the Congress of planning to redistribute people\'s property if it is voted to power. On its part, the Congress has accused the PM of resorting to ""lies"" and diverting people\'s attention from the real issues.\n\nResponding to a query, Sitharaman said it is the BJP which has set the agenda for the elections. ""Our response to the Congress\' manifesto is neither defensive nor negative, rather it is more offensive and substantive,"" she said.\n\nThe manifesto is more akin to a Muslim League document, and if not, the Congress should stand up and counter this observation (of BJP), Sitharaman said. Referring to the criticism that BJP is spreading misinformation about Congress\'s manifesto, Sitharaman said, ""What is wrong? We are asking questions. (The manifesto) is the fundamental point of departure from the Congress\'s ideology, if there was one"".\n\nAccording to Sitharaman, there is a consistency in the way the opposition is prioritising wealth and its rights on the wealth. ""The Congress is saying something in the manifesto. It is saying something more to supplement it during public rallies,"" Sitharaman said when asked why PM Modi is raising the issue of the redistribution of wealth on religious lines.\n\nShe said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has repeated this point (conducting caste census) when he spoke about doing the \'x-ray\' of the society. ""One can say that Congress did not mean it (redistribution of wealth) but they say they mean it. When PM Modi asked about it...he asked because he saw the trend....he saw the written word and also the spoken word. So he is saying that this is what they are going to do,"" Sitharaman added.'"

513,513,"b'No government is formed to do bad, it wants to do good. Some people know how to do good for others, some people wait for good things to happen. I am a person who believes in working hard and getting things done, says PM Modi.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi sat down for a 75-minute interview with News18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi, News18 Kannada Editor, Hariprasad, and News18 Lokmat Anchor Vilas Bade. During the interaction, the PM spoke of various issues including inheritance tax, the Congress manifesto, and BJP\'s electoral prospects in states such as Bihar and West Bengal.\n\nHere is the full transcript of the interview.\n\nRahul Joshi: Modi Ji, thank you for giving this exclusive interview to News18 Network. You took time out from your punishing schedule. We\'ll do this interview a bit differently. In the beginning, we\'ll ask some big picture questions. With me are my two colleagues - News18 Lokmat anchor Vilas Bade and News18 Kannada Editor Hariprasad. Maharashtra and Karnataka are two crucial states in the Lok Sabha Elections, so we thought they could also ask you a few questions.\n\nNamaskar to you and your viewers. I am happy to see that you have (interviewers from) Karnataka and Maharashtra with you. In a way, you have helped me. Otherwise, I would have had to give more time for three separate interviews.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modi ji, we have been touring the whole country. We were in the south, went to Bihar, and Maharashtra too. Whether we talk to the Opposition or your candidates, they say that \'when Modi ji comes here, everything will change\'. They say, \'Nothing can be said right now\'. \'If Modi ji comes here, it is possible that there will be a sweep, it is possible to bag the seat\'. So, can this 2024 election be seen as a referendum on Narendra Modi?\n\nNow that\'s the business of the media, how and when to analyse. But I would say this much I do not run any election-time government. If you see my record of 10 years, then on average, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, I went to some corner of India. I have been among the people and that is why my visits continue. I believe elections are the festival of democracy and as such it is the duty of all political parties to go among the people as much as possible. They should engage in dialogue and discussion. So, whether it\'s election time or not, I consider it my duty as a worker in the political field to meet the people.\n\nAs far as these two phases of elections are concerned, I have seen such public support in very few elections. In a way, the people are fighting these elections. They are fighting for good governance. They are fighting to fulfill their dreams. I feel perhaps I am just the medium. I am more enthusiastic to go among the people this time because when the people are so enthusiastic to take up such a big responsibility, I feel it is my duty to bow down to them and seek their blessings. When the first round of elections took place, I had told some friends that people who were campaigning against us were finished. After the second round, they are demolished. First, people finished them, now they demolished them.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modi ji, you started the campaign on a very high note. You introduced the entire work of the government. You moved forward with the development agenda. You shed a lot of light on the economy and a lot of work has been done on it. Now, after a couple of rounds, you made a direct attack on the Congress manifesto in a rally in Rajasthan. You even said that they have a scheme through which they want to distribute wealth. They want to find out who has how much savings, who has how much money, who has how much gold, silver and they want to distribute it among Muslims and infiltrators. Is this threat so real? Do you see it like that?\n\nI feel that maybe your team has not tracked my entire campaign. There are many good developmental things that may not be fitting in terms of TRP. But you must have seen that my entire election campaign is focused on two things. One, we have done work for the welfare of society. The biggest difference in this government [compared to previous ones] is that last-mile delivery is our specialty. See, no government is formed to do bad, it wants to do good. Some people know how to do good for others, some people wait for good things to happen. I am a person who believes in working hard and getting things done.\n\nNow see, I am continuously saying in the elections that we have built four crore houses for the poor. I tell so many people that when you go for this election campaign, please help me by sending a list of people whose houses have not been built. As soon as my third term starts, I want to take this work forward. I want to build 3 crore more houses. Now, the Ayushman Bharat Yojana is the world\'s largest health insurance and health assurance scheme. This is the assurance of treatment to 55 crore people. It is an assurance that Modi\'s government is with you. This time, we have said in the manifesto that no matter which class, society, or background a person belongs to, whoever is above 70 years of age --- both men and women --- will get free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh. This time we have also said in the manifesto that we will give this benefit to ASHA workers. We will give benefits to transgenders, no matter what their age is.\n\nNow you have seen, in our country, banks have been nationalised, and they are playing these games of confiscation. This has already been done in the past. All the banks were private, they have looted and are taking money in the name of the poor. The condition of banks in our country was miserable. More than half of the population of the country gave money to open accounts in banks, but the banks never opened their accounts. Then Modi came and opened 52 crore bank accounts, and I took the biggest advantage of it. I took the trinity of Jan Dhan, mobile, and Aadhaar and encouraged Direct Benefit Transfer. A sum of Rs 36 lakh crore --- the figure is very big --- has gone into people\'s accounts [via Direct Benefit Transfer]. This huge financial inclusion has happened in our country [due to the opening of accounts]. This is more than the number of accounts that would have opened in the world in a year. There is a Jal Jeevan Mission in our country. In India, 3-4 percent of the villages would get water from taps in their homes, that too in urban localities. Today, tap water has reached 14 crore rural families.\n\nNow, all this work is what helped 25 crore people come out of poverty. We have empowered them, and my strategy is that we give so much strength to the poor, so much power, that the poor themselves overcome poverty. And when the poor overcome poverty with their hard work, after that they do not want to go back to poverty. It becomes a commitment, and they become the strength of the country. Today, we are benefiting as 25 crore people have come out of poverty. It is a very big achievement, the world is praising it, and this will become a model for the developing countries.\n\nYou see, what was the situation before 2014? Fragile 5 used to be the headline. Today, we have become a vibrant economy. In the IMF, there is a group of 150 countries of the world --- which includes China and India --- which we can call developing countries or countries with an emerging economy. They analysed such a group by classifying them together. It is a very interesting observation.\n\nNow see what the analysis is. In 1998, India\'s per capita GDP was around 30 percent, compared to others in the peer group. At that time, Atalji\'s government was in power. From 1998 to 2004, Atal ji took this figure from 30 percent to 35 percent. It was a good progress. But unfortunately, in 2004, this khichdi company came, and this Khichdi company ruined the work of Atal ji. They brought the number down from 35 percent to 30 percent. All these countries [in the peer group] performed better than India. During the UPA regime, India became poorer compared to the other countries in the developing world. Those poorer than us went ahead.\n\nBut in 2014, after the formation of the government, till 2019, you will be happy to know that we took the figure to 37 percent. And when I reached the year 2024, this figure was 42 percent. That means our income has grown very fast as compared to other countries of the world. If you look at the inflation rate in the period of ten years, which is discussed so much, then these ten years have seen the lowest inflation. What I am saying is based on reality. We have achieved this after a lot of hard work. We have mobilised the entire government, and we have put in our best efforts to achieve the target. Despite that, what does Modi say? Modi says this is just a trailer, I must go further. I want to move very fast, taking the country along with me.\n\nAs far as the Congress manifesto is concerned, someone please tell me, are the manifestos of political parties during elections a mere showpiece? This is the work of the media to read the manifestos of every political party. I was waiting for the media to comment on it. I had commented on the manifesto on the first day. After seeing the manifesto, I feel that it has the stamp of the Muslim League. I thought that the media would be shocked. Those who do analysis will be shocked... But they just kept saying whatever is presented by the Congress. Then I thought that this seemed to be a big scam of the ecosystem and I would have to bring the truth. I waited for 10 days for the evils in the manifesto would be brought out by someone or the other because if it is brought out in an unbiased manner, it is good. Finally, I was forced to bring out these truths.\n\nYou see, when one of their mahashay gave an interview in America where he brought up the issue of inheritance tax, about 55 percent tax on your property. Now I am talking about development and inheritance, and they are talking of plundering that inheritance. Their history to date is about doing what they have mentioned in the manifesto. It is my responsibility to tell the countrymen that they are taking the country in this direction. Now you decide whether you want to go or not. But it is my responsibility that based on facts and importance, I should tell you [the truth].\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Sam Pitroda ji spoke about inheritance tax on the wealth we save for our family when we give it to the next generation. This tax could be very high. Will you say that if the BJP comes to power, it will never implement this tax?\n\nWhat the BJP plans to do is written in our manifesto. How does the thought that we will carry forward their plan even come to your mind? The ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party is clear. We go before the country with our manifesto and work. Please don\'t impose their great thoughts on us.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Rahul Gandhi has spoken about a national X-ray or socio-economic survey, along with a caste census. The institutional survey will look at which sections are behind and will redistribute the wealth accordingly...\n\nPeople who consider themselves political experts should ask such people if the conditions you (Congress) describe are real, then you have been in power for 50-60 years. You gave birth to this. Why did you let it come to this? Secondly, X-ray means raiding every household. If any woman has hidden gold where she stores grains, even that will be X-rayed. The jewels will be confiscated. Land records will be scrutinised. And these will be redistributed. This Maoist ideology has never helped the world. This is an entirely \'Urban Naxal\' thought. This is why the Jamaat, which usually keeps writing, kept quiet about the manifesto even after 10 days, because it will help them. They kept quiet to protect them. It then becomes my responsibility to awaken the country to the fact that they are planning to loot you. The next part is Dr Manmohan Singh has said clearly who has the first right on the country\'s resources. They have clearly stated their intentions.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): A video of 2006 is going viral in which Manmohan Singh ji has said that poor Muslims have the first right on resources. He has clearly said this. You have also pointed out this in the Manifesto that he would like to take a part of OBC reservation and give it to Muslims and between 2004-2014, he has tried to do this four-five times.\n\nYou have asked a very interesting question. The answer will be long but, for the sake of the country, I will have to tell you.\n\nYou see the history of Congress; this demand (for reservation) has been raised since the 1990s. There is a huge section of society in the country which felt that something should be done for them, there were protests for it. Before 1990, Congress completely opposed it and suppressed it. Then whatever commissions they formed, whatever committees they formed, their reports also started coming in favour of OBCs. They kept denying, rejecting, and suppressing these views. But after the 90s, due to vote-bank politics, they felt something must be done.\n\nSo, what was the first sin they committed? In the 90s, they decided to classify Muslims as OBCs in Karnataka. So they were rejecting and suppressing OBCs earlier, but for political gains, they labelled Muslims as OBCs. Congress was ousted from the Centre. This plan remained stalled till 2004. When Congress came back in 2004, it immediately decided to give OBC quota to Muslims in Andhra Pradesh. The matter got complicated in court. The India Parliament had decided to give 27 per cent reservation to OBCs in line with the basic spirit of the Constitution. Now, they tried to loot this 27 per cent quota.\n\nIn 2006, a meeting of the National Development Council was held where there was a huge uproar over the statement of Singh. They remained quiet for two years. In the Ghoshana Patra of 2009, they mentioned it again. In 2011, there was a Cabinet Note on this where they decided to give a share from the OBC quota to Muslims. They tried this in the UP elections too but to no avail. In 2012, the Andhra High Court cancelled it. They went to the Supreme Court, even there they did not get any relief. The 2014 Manifesto also talked about reservation based on religion. When the Constitution of India was made, no RSS or BJP people were present. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and several great men of our country were present, and after long contemplation, they decided that reservation cannot be given based on religion in a country like India.\n\nSee their manifesto for the 2024 elections. It has the imprint of the Muslim League. The way they are flouting the Constitution, the way they are insulting Ambedkar... There is a sword of danger hanging over reservation for SCs and STs. They will make life difficult for OBCs. Should I not inform the people of the country about this? I believe that it is the responsibility of all the learned people, who are rich in knowledge, who are unbiased, to educate this country, to tell it the right things.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Congress says that they have not said this specifically. What they have said in the manifesto is written that they will encourage and assist students belonging to the minorities. They have said that they will ensure minorities receive their fair share of opportunities. If they have said this, then how do you read it?\n\nI don\'t need to read it. I have given you the account from 1990 onwards. When you see the account from 1990, what will you say to me after that? Now I don\'t need to analyse it. If you look at all the things from 1990 till Manmohan Singhji\'s 2009 statement on a table, what exactly will you conclude from this? I am not concluding this, anybody will conclude this, that this is what they will do.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): They talk about partnerships in institutions, no OBC judges or no representation for the OBC in the media. How do you see this?\n\nNow tell me, when we came in 2014, did we make any policy that will stop anybody? These are their sins. It is their (Congress\'s) sins that the country is paying for. If they had followed secularism in the true sense, had done social justice in the true sense, not done vote bank politics, then they would not have had to roam around with fake papers today. I believe that whatever I have been doing for the past 10 years, the results will be such that whatever questions are asked, we will be able to answer them, based on our actions. We will give justice to everybody. How did our country get the first Adivasi President? Through our thought process. We got three chances to elect the President of India. Once during Atal-ji\'s time, twice during my tenure. Who did we elect the first time? First, we made a member of the minority community, Abdul Kalam. Then I made a Dalit (Ramnath Kovind), then an Adivasi woman (Droupadi Murmu). Our actions show our thought process.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modi-ji, you have said one more thing and I want to connect this to a longer question. You have said that if their alliance forms the government, then they will have PMs by rotation. They are not able to decide who will be made the PM, so everyone will become PM for one year. My question is a bit larger. Do you think that the stage of development India is in, a coalition government will work, or a stable government will be more effective?\n\nThese are two different questions. See the character of the Congress. In Rajasthan, there was an internal conflict within the party. They made a formula that one would be the chief minister for 2.5 years and the other would be the chief minister for the next 2.5 years. It is a known formula. There was a fight within the party in Chhattisgarh. They made the same formula there too that one would be the chief minister for 2.5 years and the other would be the chief minister for the next 2.5 years. They somehow resolved the matter and kept it going. It is also true that after 2.5 years, they backtracked. They betrayed their own party. They tend to betray their own party. That is one thing. It is proven that the Congress thinks of such a formula. I just read somewhere in the media that they had a small meeting. I read in the media that it was asked that when Modi is repeatedly asking to whom should we hand over such a big country, a name should be there, when it comes to such a big country? You will have to give a name, give anybody\'s name. Even for a cricket team, you must have a captain, even for a kabaddi team, a name is given. You are not telling who will handle such a big country. That is when they have come up with a \'One Year One PM\' formula. Every year, one new leader will take oath as the PM, make a new government and new cabinet. For five years, they will stay busy in the swearing-in events, while the country will be busy in difficult events.\n\nNow can any country run like this. It is such a big country. The country has seen instability for 30 years. We have seen the era of coalition governments. Today, the prestige of India has increased in the world because the 140-crore people of India have formed a stable, strong, and majority government. So, anyone can trust us, this government has the mandate. No one trusts a coalition government. Such a big country cannot function like this. But today the politics of the country is such that no matter how big a majority a party wins with, it has to honour regional aspirations.\n\nAnd that is why even when we got an absolute majority, we still formed the NDA government, with the help of NDA allies. Because even after a party gets an absolute majority, for the bright future of the country\'s politics and aspirations of the people of the country, regional aspirations should be given the same respect and share. This character has been developed by the NDA and the Bharatiya Janata Party has shown it can be put into practice.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Opposition parties, Rahul Gandhi, Congress, and others, all say that Modi-ji is doing match fixing. In this election, he has said that without ED, CBI and EVM, you cannot win elections. What will you say?\n\nThe answer to the EVM claim has been given by the Supreme Court of the country. In 2014, they had ED and CBI, so why did they lose? They even put my Home Minister in jail, then why did they lose?\n\nIf elections could have been won by ED-CBI, then ED-CBI\'s work has been done by the Congress for years, then they would have won. You cannot fix the election of such a big country, even for a municipality you can\'t fix this. Try it. Is this fixing possible? They are just fooling the world. The sad thing is that instead of asking those people, the media asks us.\n\nFor the past few days, the people of INDI Alliance have become so disappointed that they are looking for excuses. Because even after defeat, you need to go in front of the people. That is why I think that maybe they are already looking for all these excuses. This is probably their internal exercise.\n\nRahul Joshi: Two states are important in this election - one is Karnataka and the other Maharashtra. In Karnataka, you recently lost the assembly elections, and Maharashtra because there is a strange mess there due to a split in two parties. Two of my colleagues are with me, let\'s start with Karnataka first. Hariprasad ji, who is our editor there, wants to ask you some questions.\n\nHariprasad ji, you are welcome.\n\n(Hariprasad): Let\'s talk about the Neha Hiremath murder case, which is being widely discussed. She was killed on a college campus by Fayaz; even (BJP national president) JP Nadda rushed to her house. Do you think that the focus of the elections in Karnataka is shifting to such issues?\n\nNadda-ji was attending a programme in Karnataka when this incident took place. Who belongs to which party, or he belongs to the Congress; his daughter was murdered. These are not my values or mindset. And it is a matter of human sentiment, and I believe that even amid the election rush, what he did was the human thing to do. I don\'t remember which election it was. Rahul-ji\'s (Rahul Gandhi) aircraft faced some issues. I called him immediately to ask if he was in distress. I was the chief minister of Gujarat when, in Daman, a helicopter carrying Sonia-ji (Sonia Gandhi), Ahmed Patel sahab crashed. I told them that I am sending an air ambulance, but Ahmed Patel sahab told me that they are all fine and not in any kind of emergency. Once Sonia-ji went to Kashi for an election campaign and she fell ill, so I immediately sent people over to see what the matter is and, if required, send an aircraft to carry her. So, these are my principles, and this is beyond politics. So, for me, whenever any problem arises in any family, this should be resolved by rising above politics.\n\n(Hari Prasad): The Congress in Karnataka promised five guarantees and, after they came to power, they delivered on that. Whereas the BJP lost the last election there. Now again, there is too much focus on the leadership of BS Yediyurappa and his son due to which some within the party are also upset. How many seats do you think the BJP can win in Karnataka?\n\nNumber one, the people of Karnataka are regretting that they have committed such a big mistake by electing them (Congress). Our public support has not gone down; in fact, it has increased. But, in such a short time, they still have unresolved issues like the post of CM. While the CM has taken oath, it has not been settled who it really is. There are a lot of people who consider themselves as the CM. If you look at the law-and-order situation, there are blasts and murders taking place; the economic condition is in a state of complete bankruptcy. They made big promises and then said, if this happens, you will get this; if that happens, you will get this. This means you are cheating the public. When we said we will give Ayushman Bharat cards to certain people, we will do it, and there will be no dishonesty by adding ifs and buts. Now, if we have said we will give Ayushman cards to anyone over 70, across all classes, then we will give. You should have that courage. They cancelled the scheme for farmers, and there was no reason for it. Look at Bengaluru, it has played a big role in raising India\'s reputation across the world. Bengaluru used to be known as the tech hub and now, in no time, it has been turned into a tanker hub. And tankers also have a mafia culture.\n\nPeople are yearning for water. When it comes to scholarships for the youth, they have reduced the amount as well as the number. One after the other, they have taken such negative decisions. The issues they sought votes on, they are unable to deliver on those. Look at the deputy CM. He is asking for votes for his brother so that he can become CM; so everyone is playing games. There are games being played to remove the CM. As far as the BJP is concerned, we work with team spirit. My team may have projected me as the leader but all of us are working together. Just like that, Yediyurappa is one of our tall leaders, but the whole team is working together and working hard to move ahead.\n\n(Hariprasad): In the nation, it\'s the third phase of the Lok Sabha elections but for us in Karnataka, it\'s the second phase for 14 seats; these are in the northern part of Karnataka which is majorly drought-hit. Now, regarding this drought, the Congress is claiming that it went to the Supreme Court and now, the central government is forced to give a rightful compensation. What\'s your opinion on that?\n\nLet\'s consider the previous government led by Siddaramaiah. When there was a drought back then, I called their entire team as a prime minister and held discussions with them. We sat together and figured that we must first create schemes for water conservation. Now, as far as the state disaster relief fund is concerned, our government has already given the Centre\'s share to the state in their bank account. Our inter-ministerial team has also, under the rules and practices laid down before, visited the affected areas and conducted a survey. And it is the same process every time. When the earthquake happened in Gujarat, I sent a memorandum to the central government that sent a team for a survey to take stock of the situation. Now in the middle of this process, the model code of conduct came into force. So, I told the Election Commission about this and asked for permission. According to NDRF, we have even released a ration.\n\nRahul Joshi: Modi ji, News18 Lokmat anchor Vilas Bade has joined us from Maharashtra and wants to talk to you about the state.\n\n(Vilas Bade): Modi ji, Namaskar from Maharashtra. This time, the BJP has to retain the 23 seats it won in Maharashtra in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But it\'s a complete mess in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena and NCP have split, their two partners are with you. Are you seeing any wave of sympathy for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar?\n\nNamaskar to all the people of Maharashtra. I am pleased to be discussing Maharashtra separately with you. It\'s true that the state has been seeing coalition governments for a considerable period now. There was Vilasrao Deshmukh...Even when Sharad Pawar became the chief minister, he was not able to do so alone with an absolute majority.\n\nSecondly, it has been Maharashtra\'s misfortune that for some time now, no CM has been able to serve the five-year term. Devendra Fadnavis was the first person after a long time who served the entire term. The government then was clean and spotless. It was a government that worked for the welfare of the people.\n\nNow, there should be sympathy for us. Those who fought elections with us, those who asked for votes from the people of Maharashtra with us, developed an ego due to their personal ambition of becoming the chief minister. Because of his ego and ambition, you (Uddhav Thackeray) betrayed this partnership that dated back to the days of Balasaheb Thackeray. People are angry about it and there is sympathy for the BJP because of this.\n\nSecondly, the storms that erupted within the Shiv Sena or the NCP clearly show what happens when you give importance to only your family members over other leaders it leads to difficulties. The trouble in Sharad Pawar\'s house is their family dispute. Should the daughter get the reins or the nephew? Similar is the tussle in Shiv Sena like the Congress - should a deserving leader be promoted or the son?\n\nThese are their disputes. I believe our country hates such dynasty politics. If someone tries to use the word \'sympathy\' to evoke sympathy among people, I say even that attempt will fail. People hate such things. They cannot accept such things. These are your family disputes, resolve them within your home. Why are you ruining the state of Maharashtra over this?\n\nAnother thing is that the BJP has sacrificed for Maharashtra. Some people thought that we wanted the CM\'s seat. No. We could have taken the CM\'s seat but didn\'t. We convinced the people of Maharashtra that we live for Maharashtra, not for ourselves. And in this election, this sympathy is in our favour that such a big party, with a chief minister who has been successful is now a deputy chief minister, has sort of put its self-respect on the back burner for the bright future of Maharashtra.\n\nI believe in our country, Bengal has been ruined, Kolkata was once leading the economic growth, but is ruined by politics. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were earlier reduced to unstable conditions. Maharashtra should not be allowed to go down that route. Mumbai is the economic capital of the country. We should move ahead strongly in Maharashtra for the benefit of the country. We are conveying this sentiment to the people of Maharashtra; we are convincing them and the people of Maharashtra are giving us a very positive response.\n\n(Vilas Bade): In Maharashtra, there is the grand alliance (Mahayuti) of BJP, Shiv Sena, and NCP, but there is a lot of tussles for seats till the last moment in these elections. The distribution of tickets has also not been done in many places. Does this not raise a big question mark for the Mahayuti?\n\nI think the problems you mentioned apply to the opposition. They have not been able to decide seats, they are unable to take decisions, and parallel elections are being fought there. There is nothing of such sort on our side. We have joined hands and are out to fight unitedly. We have prepared well in advance. Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP have done it. There is no harmony among the fake parties of the opposition.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): How many seats do you expect in Maharashtra?\n\nWe are moving ahead with a lot of strength. Votes will go up and the seats will too.\n\n(Vilas Bade): In 2017, your government bestowed Sharad Pawar with the Padma Vibhushan, the country\'s second-highest civilian honour. But last Tuesday, Sharad Pawar said, ""Modi is becoming the country\'s new Putin."" How do you see this comment?\n\nI respect him a lot. It doesn\'t matter whether people who have been in public life for long are with us or against us, we respect them. But this means that he is proud of receiving the award from a government headed by someone he sees as Putin. This is a big contradiction.\n\nAs far as my party and my opinions are concerned... We gave the Bharat Ratna to Pranab Mukherjee, Narasimha Rao, Chaudhary Charan Singh, Karpoori Thakur. Nobody in this country questioned our choices. Everybody understood it was long due and well-deserved. They were from opposition parties and had even criticised us in the past, but our decision was not based on such things. Consider the Padma awardees -- Mulayam Singh, Tarun Gogoi, PA Sangma, SM Krishna... were all from other parties but we gave them Padma awards for their contributions to their respective fields. It is the country\'s award to give, not a party\'s. It\'s not Modi\'s personal property. BJP doesn\'t have a copyright on it.\n\nIf you are interested, a story to look at is how Padma awards have changed in the country. We have transformed it. We should be lauded for the thought behind such decisions, not questioned about the choice of recipients.\n\nVilas Bade: But even after receiving the award, Sharad Pawar gave such a statement...\n\nBut the fact is there is no condition to the award that they cannot speak against me. There is no such agreement. This is not a give-and-take formula.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modi ji, let\'s talk about Uttar Pradesh. It is the biggest state with 80 Lok Sabha seats. Will you be able to break the record of 2014? The BJP had won 71 seats back then, and the NDA 73. This time, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi are fighting the election together. Akhilesh ji has fielded the whole family; he himself is fighting from Kannauj. Dimple is fighting from Mainpuri. His family members are fighting from Firozabad to Azamgarh. There are speculations that the Gandhis will fight from Amethi and Rae Bareli. How do you see it?\n\nRahul ji, even though you are repeating proudly that everyone is the election fray, is it a compulsion or not? They are forced to field family members. It is their compulsion. That\'s their main character. They don\'t have anything else. To fight for family members and to make family members fight in elections: that\'s the game.\n\nAlso, didn\'t they join forces before? They have united before, many times. But the people of Uttar Pradesh understand what is good for them. I said in Parliament that today the situation in Uttar Pradesh and the country is such that big leaders are withdrawing from the Lok Sabha race and trying to take the Rajya Sabha route. And that\'s what it is. Big leaders are not ready to fight the elections. But we are working responsibly, taking everyone along and performing our duties. And I think nothing will be left of them this time around. Nothing.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): One more question. You have already answered it partly. So, I will keep it short. The Opposition, the Congress says the government is misusing the ED, CBI, and intelligence agencies. You have said that the ED is independent. A newspaper did an analysis that when 25 opposition leaders joined the BJP, cases against 23 of them were either shelved or dropped.\n\nFirstly, not one case has been dropped. Whatever the courts decide will happen. They are independent. Second, how many such cases pertain to the political leadership? Only 3%. Even big bureaucrats are in jail. After all, why were these agencies formed? If these agencies were formed with a purpose, won\'t they fulfill that? Our courts are supreme anyway... The courts must examine it. And let\'s not take the matter of corruption lightly. There should be a debate around this. There was a time when even accusations would shake things up. And today, even after conviction and punishment, some are waving and having their photos taken. Are they glorifying corruption? This should be criticised. Corruption shouldn\'t be treated as a new normal. Otherwise, it will hurt the country a lot. This is not about BJP vs others.\n\nI see that slowly an environment is being created where it is being thought: \'Oh, that\'s alright. That happens.\' [But] Poor people are dying. We must rid the country of corruption. That should be the country\'s resolve. I believe in making the system policy-driven. Use technology. Earlier, a prime minister used to say a rupee goes [towards the people] but only 15 paise reach them. Today I say when a rupee goes out, the full 100 paise reaches - Direct Benefit Transfer. How? By improving the system! We launched the GeM portal, a big step towards reducing corruption. Second, we must awaken society. Let society also be made conscious that corruption cannot be tolerated at any level. That environment is being created in the country. But political people are not afraid. Someone would support them [the corrupt] just because they would want to oppose us. This is not correct.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): You accomplished a lot of big achievements in your last tenure. You scrapped Article 370, you brought in the CAA. But, in their campaign, opposition leaders are saying that they will repeal the CAA if they form the government. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is saying that she will not allow the implementation of CAA. How do you see this?\n\nFirstly, whoever understands the Constitution of India, whoever knows the federal structure of India, and whoever knows what is in whose jurisdiction, won\'t ever say such things. Because this is not in their jurisdiction. If Modi is the chief minister of a state, he can\'t do such things. The central government will do what is in its ambit. A state government will do whatever is in its ambit. But fooling the people is a trend nowadays - to keep them in the dark. That\'s why they keep saying anything at all.\n\nSecondly, I challenge the Congress party to hold a press conference and say they will restore 370. They talk big about the Constitution. They talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar. They abuse us so much. But Babasaheb Ambedkar\'s Constitution was not applicable to the entire nation. For 70 years, the Indian Constitution was not applicable in Jammu and Kashmir. There, Dalits are getting reservations for the first time [after the Article 370 move]. The Valmiki community is getting reservations for the first time. What are they talking about? Do they have the courage to hold a press conference and say \'We\'ll bring back Article 370\'? Can any party dare say that?\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modi ji, let\'s move towards Bengal. The election there is being fought with full vigour. Last time, in 2019, when you won 18 of the 42 seats there, people were surprised. This time, one of your leaders has said that you will win 36 seats. Rajnath Singh Ji told me in an interview that the BJP could win 36 seats. How do you assess the situation?\n\nThe problem with these people, who you say were surprised, is that they -- even after 10 years -- are not ready to believe that the citizens of this country elected someone named Modi as their prime minister. There is a section that is not willing to accept the mandate of the country. It\'s a reality - the people of the country are supporting us. You thought that it wouldn\'t happen. It\'s your fault. I was in Malda recently. I was surprised; the atmosphere was electrifying. People believe that there is a strong and stable government at the Centre and that Bengal too should benefit from it. Women are facing atrocities under the TMC rule.\n\nThe events of Sandeshkhali have jolted the nation. People have the right to vote, and they will vent their anger in the process. So, the outburst is natural. You have seen the piles of banknotes seized. Have you ever seen such big stashes of money getting caught earlier? In recent years, you have seen stashes of Rs 50 crore, Rs 300 crore, Rs 250 crore, Rs 200 crore. The nation is shocked. No matter how much you try to hide it, the nation now understands that these people are looters.\n\nRahul Joshi: So, you expect a bigger victory this time (in Bengal)?\n\nAbsolutely, it will be a clean sweep.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): How do you see Odisha? You have not gone with the BJD (Biju Janata Dal).\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party has operated separately there. The BJD has given us issue-based support at the Centre, as have many other parties. That was our relationship with BJD... At the state level, Odisha is losing its self-respect. Odia language is under threat. I don\'t think that the people of Odisha will be able to tolerate this for long. It has such a lot of resources that today Odisha could have been the richest state of India. But what kind of condition has been created? The common people of Odisha aspire. And I think we (BJP) should get a chance to serve. We will take Odisha to great heights.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Let\'s talk about Bihar. In Bihar, you have once again formed a coalition with Nitish ji [Nitish Kumar] and are fighting together. How do you see it? Last time, you won 39 seats out of 40. Can you repeat that performance?\n\nFirstly, we fought the assembly elections together. Later, they went somewhere and then came back. So, we are together as per the mandate of the people. As far as public support is concerned, I was in Bihar just recently, and I can see it clearly. Even when there is no tent overhead or anything in this heat, still lakhs of people are connected to us. I can see it clearly. Earlier, we used to lose one-odd seat in Bihar, but this time maybe we will not lose even one.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modiji, I would like to ask you a personal question. You have seen many elections. You have been in Gujarat for a long time. This is your third election at the Centre. I have seen that from time to time, during elections, personal attacks are often made against you. Sometimes it is said that PM Modi should be shot, sometimes it is said that his head should be broken. Recently, Rahul Gandhi also said some words which can be considered personal attacks. Why does this happen to PM Modi?\n\nI do not have an answer to this but why should Modi be asked this question? This question should be discussed in the country and in public life. After all, what is Modi\'s crime? He became the prime minister, that is his crime, isn\'t it? That means whatever abuses you are hurling; you are hurling them at the prime minister. To say things like we will bash the prime minister\'s head or to abuse my mother... I am shocked that even the President of India was insulted. I am ashamed of this. I have always considered voters and the country my family. I am going forward with a positive attitude, but I leave the responsibility on people like you and the voters to deal with such people as they deem fit.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): Modiji, I want to ask how your third term will be different from the first and second.\n\nHow was my first term? I wanted to address the basic needs of the common man. I worked in that direction. At that time, there was an atmosphere of despair in the country, an atmosphere of hatred towards the government. I had to instill confidence. I worked on that. In the second term, I showed some results, filled people with confidence that we can move forward. A level of confidence has come in the country. That confidence is a very big strength.\n\nNow, after the expectations have been transformed into confidence, into aspirations, I want to make the country the third economic superpower in my third term. This will be a continuity -- after bringing the country from the 11th to the fifth spot [size of economy in the world]. During Manmohan Singh\'s tenure, we were at 11, we brought it to five after a lot of effort, and now we will put in some more effort and take the country to the third spot. So, we want to maintain continuity in every sector.\n\nFor instance, we started a big campaign to provide electricity -- and successfully provided it. Now my aim is PM Surya Ghar Yojana and zero electricity bills. I want solar panels in every household. And I just don\'t want electricity bills to be zero, but I want three things. One, every household\'s power bill should be zero; second, we should sell surplus electricity and earn money; and third, I want to be self-reliant in the energy sector as the era of electric vehicles will come. This is why I would like that whoever has a scooter or car should be able to charge it at home through solar energy. This means the transportation cost of Rs 1,000-Rs 2,000 per month for the person should also become zero. This will benefit the citizens and the country will get the benefit of a clean environment. The billions of dollars that are being spent on importing petroleum will stop. So, it\'s a scheme with multiple benefits. I want to make a start-up hub, manufacturing hub, and innovation hub. I want to take the country to a completely new area with a lot of confidence. My vision is clear, I have no doubts. After June 4, I am clear what I have to do in the next 100 days as well as by 2047. I am clear of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. That is why I say 24 by 7 for 2047.\n\n(Vilas Bade): You have faced a lot of difficulties in your journey. But, even in such situations, you make tough decisions. How are you able to do this?\n\nI don\'t make tough decisions; I make the right decisions. Decisions are not tough, decisions should be right; some find them tough. But, sometimes, I do think about how all of this is possible. Just as you are surprised, I too wonder how Modi does this. Then I think, no, maybe God has sent me for this work. Whatever I am doing is inspired by a divine power. This could be God\'s gift, God wants me to do this work and has sent me with a purpose here. And, that\'s why, I remain far from the storm.\n\nVilas Bade: But how do you remain calm in this storm?\n\nI remain far from it. God has shown me this path, that you should not get entangled in other things and you must do some big work and must remain engaged with that. So, it is God\'s direction, God\'s wish, God\'s plan, and, perhaps, their influence. I am only an instrument.\n\n(Rahul Joshi): I want to ask you something related. We see you, we get your schedule; you are travelling so much, holding five to six rallies from one state to the other. In all of this, how do you stay fit? What is that power that gives you this strong resolve to move forward?\n\nFirstly, as I said, I am not doing anything. God has decided this, and God has probably sent me to do this work. I was born in a family, where my mother was uneducated, and had not seen a school. I do not have any political background, and it\'s such a big country. So, if this is not God\'s will, then what is it? And for me, there are two Gods - one that we cannot see and the other is the public. I consider the public a form of God. And I have faith in the Almighty, who has sent me for this work while the public has blessed me. As to the question of how I am able to work so much, I do not live for myself. I always keep in mind that whatever time I have, I should work for my country every moment. As far as I have been running around, this is a big celebration, like a festival.\n\nIt is an opportunity to reach out to the public, visit them, and talk to them. We should see it like that and take advantage of it, meet the public and visit people. It is a celebration of democracy in which we should be involved. So, I consider it like we do when there\'s an important puja at home and the way we are involved in it. This is a time for prayers for me as I am worshipping 140 crore gods. I move with this feeling, which keeps me going. I never get tired because I return home after seeing God.\n\nRahul Joshi: Modiji, thank you so much. You took out so much time for us. Like your slogan, we too have a slogan this time - \'agli baar, sirf News18 par aar paar\'. Thank you very much for giving us your time.\n\nThank you very much. Namaskar. My greetings to everyone.'"
514,514,"b'Union home minister Amit Shah during an exclusive interview with Network18 Group.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Network18 Group Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi, Union home minister Amit Shah spoke about BJP\'s resolve of \'400 paar\' in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. He also bashed out at the opposition over the EVM tampering charges and took a dig at the Congress over its election manifesto while accusing the party of promoting personal laws and politics of appeasement.\n\nHere\'s the full transcript of the interview:\n\nQ1: Amit ji, thank you very much for this exclusive interview with News18 Network. We are in your city, your constituency Gandhinagar, at the Sabarmati Riverfront. Let\'s begin. If you look at the first two phases, and this is being discussed a lot, the voter turnout has been low, in some states by 5-6%. So your slogan is \'400 paar\', 370 for the Bharatiya Janata Party. Is that on track?\n\nAmit Shah: It is absolutely on track. You will see on counting day, before 12.30 pm, NDA will cross 400, Modi ji will again become Prime Minister. There are many reasons for the lower turnout. After twelve years, the electoral rolls have been revised. The second reason is that there is no contest from the other side, which affects the turnout in a way.\n\nMy party\'s team and I have done a detailed analysis. We are moving towards the third phase with well over 100 seats from the first two. I don\'t see any problem in crossing the target of 400.\n\nQ2: First let us start with the important issues. What are those issues with which the Bharatiya Janata Party is going to the people for the third time? If you could tell us briefly about the achievements that you would take to the public.\n\nAmit Shah: Firstly, terrorism and Naxalism had been two major scourges for democracy and development in this country for decades. Narendra Modiji has got us almost 100% freedom from terrorism in ten years and you could say Naxalism has been eliminated by around 95%. Today Naxalism has been completely finished off in the seven states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. It remains only in four districts of Chhattisgarh, where the Bharatiya Janata Party has now formed the government, and just in the past three months, almost 100 Naxalites have been killed. I am fully confident that after Modiji becomes the Prime Minister for the third time, the country will get rid of Naxalism within one or two years.\n\nThe second big challenge is that the country\'s economy was in a shambles because of all the mismanagement, policies were not being made, production activities had slowed down, exports were in free fall, the balance sheets of all the public sector banks of the country could not be made honestly. This was the situation. Inflation was touching the sky, and all the 16 parameters of the budget were negative. But in just 10 years, Narendra Modiji has brought about a sea change. The share market is skyrocketing. Even after selling by FIIs, Indian mutual funds have bolstered the market. Due to the PLI scheme and a strong ecosystem, India has become a favourite destination for manufacturing in the whole world. Our children are registering start-ups every day, our companies are registering patents daily, a lot of self-employment opportunities have been created. The balance sheets of all the banks have become very healthy. All the industrial growth parameters are at the topmost markings of 25 years. Exports are surging ahead while breaking records.\n\nSimilarly, the sectors which are going to drive the world economy for the next 25 years, India has become a pioneer in all those areas today, such as green hydrogen manufacturing, semiconductors, though we are a little late, electrical motor vehicle, battery production, space, again, though we are a little late, but defence too. In many such areas which are going to determine the direction and fate of the world economy for the next 25 years, today India has laid a strong foundation there and a big building is to be built on this foundation.\n\nSo the economy has also improved, it has also become safe. The country was number 11 in the list of economies, now it is fifth. Be it village or city, forest or desert, coast or city, work is being done for the development of infrastructure everywhere. Today, 10 lakh crore rupees being spent on infrastructure from the budget has become common for India. GST collection and direct tax collection are breaking all their own records. Narendra Modi has also done great work in strengthening the borders of the country.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the nation\'s leadership to build trust among the people that the future of India is bright and Narendra Modi has succeeded in that in a big way. Today, 130 crore people are moving ahead with confidence that we can become number 1 in the world. Whether it is higher education, new economic policy, or Ram Janmabhoomi, ending Article 370 sections, triple talaq, bringing UCC or fundamental changes in the criminal laws of the country, these 10 years will be written about in golden letters in every field. People are also feeling that a pandemic like corona could be fought off so effectively only because of the work of Narendra Modi.\n\nAlso read | Amit Shah Interview: Home minister\'s \'sharia\' dig at Congress\'s manifesto\n\nQ3: Your knowledge of financial and economic issues is, of course, excellent and you answered this in great detail. I have a related question. When your party\'s campaign began, for a few months we saw the government talking about economy, development, all those things that you just mentioned, and taking those issues amid the people. After the first phase, it turned towards issues like appeasement, Hindu-Muslim. Your party attacked the Congress manifesto, the Prime Minister said in a rally in Rajasthan that there is a stench of Urban Naxal and Maoist thoughts in this. Where did that come from?\n\nAmit Shah: It is our responsibility to expose the intentions of those who contest elections against us. Tell me, in this era, can any political party talk of personal laws? Will the country run on the basis of Sharia? On the one hand, in our manifesto, in our Sankalp Patra, we talk about bringing a uniform civil code. Congress is saying that it will promote personal laws. The Congress must answer because this is a very important issue.\n\nQ4: That is why you are saying that it is the imprint of the Muslim League?\n\nAmit Shah: Exactly, it is the imprint of the Muslim League... They are saying that for the contracts of the country, they will give priority to minorities. Who is the first lowest, what is the past performance, whether they have the capability to do the work or not, will contracts be decided on the basis of this or on the basis of religion? How do they want to run the country? The people of the country will have to decide. After a long time, Narendra Modi ji has taken the country out of the politics of appeasement. They want to take it back in the same direction again because the Congress does not have the confidence to win.\n\nQ5: The Prime Minister also said in the rally that the savings of everyone will be checked and the wealth will be redistributed among Muslims and infiltrators. Where does this come from?\n\nAmit Shah: It comes from the statement of the then Prime Minister of the country, Manmohan Singh, which was a very famous statement that the minorities have the first right to the resources of this country, and among the minorities, particularly Muslims. Now when it comes to distributing wealth, it will be from resources only. The government will distribute it by taking people\'s property. And I say that if this is not true, then the Congress party should clarify what this means.\n\nQ6: No, Rahul Gandhi has clearly said that if they form the government, there will be a \'nationwide X-ray\' to determine the socio-economic status of the people, how much wealth which caste or section has, how much money, how much share in institutions, and on that basis there will be redistribution.\n\nAmit Shah: So on that basis in redistribution, their priority is set.\n\nAlso read | Amit Shah interview | Opposition rakes up the EVM issue selectively, says Home Minister\n\nQ7: He is saying this is the only way to end inequality...\n\nAmit Shah: That\'s his thinking. I think that such an old party has outsourced the making of its manifesto to minorities and people from the extreme Left.\n\nQ8: So where did the issue of \'mangalsutra\' come from? Is that also...\n\nAmit Shah: Naturally, when the issue of wealth comes, all these things are included.\n\nAmit Shah: I feel that Sam Pitroda is living in an ivory tower. He has no connection with the culture of this country, the mood of the people, and the traditions of this country.\n\nQ11: So you will never bring any inheritance tax?\n\nAmit Shah: We have placed our Sankalp Patra in front of the people with total transparency. All the facts are there. We will not do anything covertly.\n\nQ12: Another thing that is being discussed right now is that after seeing the manifesto of the Congress, your party is saying that they will reduce OBC reservation and give it to Muslims...\n\nAmit Shah: This is not mentioned in this manifesto, this is what their government has already done in Karnataka. Overnight all the Muslims of Karnataka were made backward. No survey for backwardness was done, no commission was formed. All the people were declared backward on the basis of religion. And they were given reservation. And the reservation that was reduced was of OBCs.\n\nSimilarly, when they had government in united Andhra Pradesh, they gave reservation to Muslims. So, whose reservation was reduced? Of course, of SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\nWhen I said that we would end the reservation on the basis of religion, then my video was distorted and presented in front of the public.\n\nAfter Rahul Gandhi took over the command of Congress\'s politics, he has been consistently bringing down the level of politics in an unprecedented way. You cannot debate in Parliament, they create chaos, boycott, not let people speak, not participate in debates, and then go out and tell the world that injustice is being done to them. What do they think about the people of this country? That the public does not know all this? The people of the country know all these things very well. There should be healthy debate in a democracy. And you people also do not ask them anything. You people should also ask. But you people ask questions only to us, you do not ask them.\n\nAlso read | Amit Shah interview | Share markets skyrocketing under Modi govt; Indian economy has become safe, says home minister\n\nQ13: We are asking them as well, our team is doing that. One issue is the question of the Caste Census. They talk about it and say \'Jitni Abadi Utna Haq\'. How do you see that?\n\nAmit Shah: For how many years has the Congress been in power in this country? It was in power for 55 years. It has never done anything. Now when they are losing continuously, they are saying all these things; this is not their intention.\n\nIf there is any party in this country that is against the backward class, then it is only one party, the Congress party. They did not open the Kakasaheb Kalelkar Commission for years. They suppressed the Mandal Commission. OBC and backward class people were not given reservation in central institutions. When the Mandal Commission recommendations were being implemented, as opposition leader Rajiv Gandhi had delivered a speech in protest for two hours. Rahul Gandhi should read that speech.\n\nAnd we have given the country the most successful Prime Minister from the backward class and a poor family, a natural leader in the form of Narendra Modi.\n\nQ14: Is this a narrative-building exercise that if you get more than 400 seats then you will change Babasaheb\'s Constitution and then make changes to OBC, SC, ST reservations? Do you think that\'s the narrative being created?\n\nAmit Shah: We have been in majority for ten years. The people of this country have given Narendra Modi the power to change the Constitution for ten years.\n\nWhat have we done in these ten years? We never tried to end reservation. We used our majority to abrogate Article 370, to end triple talaq, to bring UCC, to change the laws of the British, to bring peace in Kashmir. We have had the right for ten years.\n\nRahul Gandhi has a rule -- lie, lie loudly, lie repeatedly. And he is following that rule.\n\nQ15: Do you think that this is why he keeps repeating this narrative?\n\nAmit Shah: No narrative has been formed. We have had this right for ten years.\n\nQ16: You spoke about security, so I would like to talk a little about this as well. You have said that recently you have cracked down on Naxals. You have said that in 2-3 years you will finish them in Chhattisgarh also. Some Congress leaders called them martyrs. How do you view this?\n\nAmit Shah: See, Tulsidas ji has said in Ramcharitmanas that whoever is going through bad times, Lord Ram first takes away their wisdom. That time has probably come for Congress people also. Our soldiers are risking their lives and conducting operations inside dense forests, killing Naxals. Naxalites say that their cadre has been killed. And the Congress party says that it is a fake encounter. Only God can save them. Or perhaps even God cannot save them.\n\nQ17: Your government has done a lot of great work in this past term. You have abrogated Article 370, you have implemented CAA, brought the criminal procedure laws. You have done a lot of such great work. But if you look at the opposition today, many opposition leaders say that they will bring back Article 370, they will not allow CAA to be implemented. And these are big leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Chidambaram ji. They say such things. So how do you see this? What would you like to say?\n\nAmit Shah: This is their trick to get the votes of minorities. Neither will they come to power nor will Article 370 come back. Neither will they come to power nor will CAA be repealed. They also know this. But they want to book minority votes by doing minority appeasement. This is the only reason they are spreading these lies.\n\nIn this interview, I want to tell the people of the country through you that as long as there is even a single MP of Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament, Article 370 cannot come back, CAA cannot be abolished. Now Article 370 has become history, and CAA has become a reality.\n\nQ18: Have you just abruptly implemented this or will people get citizenship through this route as well? When will this become possible? What is the timeframe?\n\nAmit Shah: Applications have started to come in. Scrutiny is happening according to the rules. And I think before the elections, before the last phase, the process of giving citizenship will start.\n\nQ19: Amit ji, you all are talking about uniform civil code. Congress is talking about personal laws. How do you see this? Somewhere, are both sides just appeasing their own voters?\n\nAmit Shah: Not at all. Uniform civil code is the mandate of our Constitution, the guiding principles that the Constitution has given us that the legislature and Parliament of the country will have to make efforts at the right time to implement uniform civil code in this country.\n\nI think the right time has come. And we are not saying this today. Before our party was formed, it was in the manifesto that there should not be any religious laws in the country, there should be uniform civil code. If this a secular country, how can there be laws on the basis of religion? There should not be.\n\nAlso read | Amit Shah Interview | May even win 80/80 in Uttar Pradesh, says Home Minister\n\nQ20: Salman Khurshid, just a few days ago... his statement is going viral, when he was saying that the UPA-1 and UPA-2 governments were formed only because Congress could claw back enlightened Muslims into its fold. How do you see this?\n\nAmit Shah: This exactly must be the basis of their manifesto. Salman Khurshid has let out the secret of why their manifesto is what it is... They want to do the same thing. But they don\'t realise that the people of the country are now aware.\n\nYour appeasement policy will not succeed now because when you do appeasement towards one group, a second one will counterproductively unite on the other side with that awareness. Now it will not succeed.\n\nQ21: There has been a discussion about infiltrators. You implemented CAA. But there is no mention of NRC in your manifesto. Why is that?\n\nAmit Shah: Look, the implementation of CAA was delayed due to Covid. And we believe that CAA should be implemented first. That process is going on.\n\nAs far as the question of infiltration is concerned, now it is happening only in one state. West Bengal. Because it has the Mamata Banerjee government\'s blessings. That\'s because she sees infiltrators as a vote bank. They do not see infiltration as a national security threat. They think that their vote bank is growing. This is very dangerous thinking not only for Bengal but for the entire country.\n\nI want to make a heartfelt appeal to the people of Bengal that make the BJP successful this time. After that, ensure the formation of a BJP government there. We will build such a border that not even a bird will be able to sneak across.\n\nQ22: Is this why they are opposing CAA? They are saying that they will never allow CAA to be implemented.\n\nAmit Shah: They do not know that citizenship is a central subject and the state government has nothing to do with it. Maybe they know but they say this to mislead the minorities.\n\nQ23: Amit ji, on January 22, the Pran Pratishtha at Ram Mandir took place. This was a big promise of yours which you fulfilled. But the opposition says that today in this election you are asking for votes in the name of Ram.\n\nAmit Shah: We used to get votes in the name of Ram when the temple was not built and we used to say that we will build it. We in fact ended the reason to ask for votes.\n\nThe opposition is worried and the whole country is angry with them because when the Ram Mandir was built peacefully, constitutionally, and Pran Pratishtha was happening, they boycotted it. They did not go to the Pran Pratishtha of Lord Ram out of fear of annoying the minorities. That is why the whole country is angry with them.\n\nWe never said that give us votes because we built the Ram temple. The citizens of the country know that these people had kept the issue hanging for seventy years. Modi ji won the case in five years, did the Bhoomi Pujan, and also did the Pran Pratishtha. And now a grand Ram temple that gladdens the entire country is coming up.\n\nQ24: One last question I want to ask you about the Hindu-Muslim debate that has been happening, which is that the Prime Minister did an outreach towards Pasmanda Muslims about a year ago, spoke about them, and he also thinks a lot about them. On the one hand, this is being discussed, and on the other, isn\'t there a contradiction in this?\n\nAmit Shah: Not at all. The Prime Minister has not only reached out to the Pasmanda Muslims. He has done it for tribals, Dalits, backward classes, the poor, the farmers, the women and \'matra shakti\', and the youth as well. That is his work, it is his duty.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the government to bring those who are lagging behind in the race of development to the same level as everyone else. I don\'t see any contradiction in this.\n\nQ25: It\'s election season, you are with us, and people talk about your predictions for a long time that Amitji had said this earlier, and it turned out to be accurate. So let\'s go to some states. We are in Gujarat with you, so let\'s start with Gujarat. In the last two elections, you got all 26 seats. Are you hopeful of a hat trick?\n\nAmit Shah: Certainly, we will get all 26 seats in Gujarat. And the margins will also be higher than in the 2019 elections for all seats.\n\nQ26: There has been some talk that kshatriyas are a little upset with your leaders...\n\nAmit Shah: We are constantly communicating with them. I have full faith that everything will be fine. We will win all 26 seats and our margins will also go up.\n\nQ27: Let\'s go to Karnataka next. It is an important election for you. The last time you had a big victory there but you also faced defeat in the recent assembly elections. How do you see Karnataka, especially after the Revanna episode, on which you have also given a statement in a press conference? How do you see the situation of the exploited women there, because the party has a tie-up with you, you have an alliance with them. So will you come under the pressure of the alliance? What strict action will you take?\n\nAmit Shah: I have made the stand of the Bharatiya Janata Party clear that the strictest steps should be taken. But Priyanka ji and Rahul ji are saying why steps are not being taken. Perhaps they do not understand the position. The law and order of a state has to be dealt with by the state government. And they are in power there. They have to take the steps, not us.\n\nBut the Bharatiya Janata Party strongly condemns this incident. No matter who it is or what the situation is, this cannot be tolerated, and the strictest steps should be taken. And the Women\'s Commission of the Government of India has also issued a notice to the Karnataka government on this.\n\nQ29: There was also the Neha Hiremath case. The case has been given the colour of love jihad...\n\nAmit Shah: No, not colour. It is definitely a case of love jihad.\n\nQ30: That is what I wanted to ask you. But the chief minister and home minister said it was a personal matter.\n\nAmit Shah: They said that for their minority vote bank. Tell me one thing. Should any girl get security on the college campus or not? This is how a murder happens and by calling it a personal matter, you are trying to cover up a societal evil. And just for vote bank politics.\n\nThey even mistake bomb blasts for gas cylinder blasts. When NIA investigates, it uncovers the truth. There were no bomb blasts in Bengaluru for 10 years. Their government came, the SDPI supported it, and now bomb blasts have started happening.\n\nHow low will they go because of their vote bank politics? The security of the country, the security of Bengaluru, the security of Karnataka, all this has been neglected by the Congress party.\n\nQ31: With all this in mind, how many seats do you give the Bharatiya Janata Party and its alliance in Karnataka?\n\nAmit Shah: One election is yet to be held, but I think that more or less we will keep our position intact.\n\nQ32: About the same number of seats that you had earlier. This is a big statement from you. Moving towards Maharashtra, a strange situation exists there. Two parties have split. One faction of each is with you. They are fighting over who is original. But in such a situation, do you think that there can be some sympathy for Uddhav and Sharad Pawar?\n\nAmit Shah: The people of Maharashtra are with Modiji, whoever is with Modiji will get votes. This election is being fought to decide who becomes the country\'s Prime Minister. There are two sides. One is the NDA under the leadership of Narendra Modiji. And the other is Rahul Baba, Sharad Pawar, Mamata Didi, Stalin, Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Yadav, who are heading the INDI Alliance, which has no leader.\n\nNow the people of the country have to decide which person to pick. On the one hand is the INDI Alliance responsible for scams and corruption worth Rs 12 lakh crore. On the other hand, there is Narendra Modi who despite being a chief minister and Prime Minister for 23 years has never been accused of corruption of even twenty-five paise. On the one hand, there is a group that goes on vacations as soon as the summers come. Foreign vacations because the heat is very high here. And on the other hand, there is Narendra Modi who did not take leave even on the day of Diwali for 23 years and celebrated Diwali with the soldiers at the border. On the one hand, there are political parties that work for their sons, daughters, nephews, and daughters-in-law, and on the other hand, there is Narendra Modi who works for the poor, the women, the farmers, and the youth of the country.\n\nSo, the people of the country have to decide whether they want a person who will protect the nation or those who will put the country at risk for votes. Do they want a person who will develop the economy of the country or those who will sink the economy? The people of the country have decided Rahulji, the people of the country are with Narendra Modi ji, and the party which is with Modi ji will get votes. This election is to make Narendra Modi ji the Prime Minister.\n\nQ33: You got 41 seats the last time when you had an alliance. This time...\n\nAmit Shah: Let the results come. You will be surprised. We will get to 400 from there.\n\nQ34: So you have full confidence from Maharashtra that you will definitely win 41?\n\nAmit Shah: Sure, the figure of 41 may become 40 or 42, but the result will be more or less the same. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, we will repeat the results there. In Uttar Pradesh, we will increase our seats by five to seven. In Odisha, we will go up to 16. And in Assam also we will go above twelve, it may be twelve. In West Bengal, we will win at least thirty seats.\n\nQ35: The last time you had told me 25 in an interview. With 30, we can now add and see if 370 will be crossed. You have given us all the numbers. In Odisha, there is no friendship any longer. You\'ll (BJP and BJD) have gone separate ways. In an interview with me, the PM said this is about Odisha\'s reputation this time. How do you see it?\n\nAmit Shah: I clearly believe that Odisha is lagging in terms of development. Along with this, the language of Odisha, the culture of Odisha, the fabric of Odisha and its dignity are also being seriously hurt. The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that the culture of any state should not be tampered with. The development of every state should take place by exploiting its maximum potential, which is not happening in Odisha at the moment. That is why we have decided that we will fight separately. I am fully confident that this time the people of Odisha will bless the Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Modi ji.\n\nQ36: You gave a big number for the Lok Sabha elections. How do you view the state elections?\n\nAmit Shah: Assessment is still ongoing... I have only had one round, assessment will happen, but I can say with certainty that the people of Odisha will bless the Bharatiya Janata Party this time.\n\nQ38: In Uttar Pradesh, you said the number of seats won will increase from the last time?\n\nAmit Shah: In Uttar Pradesh, increasing seats means... if everything goes well, we can win 80 out of 80.\n\nQ40: This means that you will defeat Akhilesh in Kannauj, Dimple in Mainpuri, their entire family in Firozabad, Azamgarh...\n\nAmit Shah: I have said it\'s a possibility that we can win 80 out of 80. It is certain that our seats will increase.\n\nQ41: Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi are still undecided about fighting the elections. Now, it is being said that they may not. How do you see this?\n\nAmit Shah: These people have lost their self-confidence. They don\'t have the self-confidence to fight even from their ancestral seat. If they didn\'t want to fight, why have they kept the decision on the seat pending for so long? If they had given it to a worker, at least he could have done some public outreach. This confusion somewhere reflects the lack of self-confidence.\n\nQ42: Amit ji, we were in Bihar for a few days. The alliance that is getting formed there with Tejashwi and others is trying to cut votes in some of your seats.\n\nQ44: Talking about south India. This time, you\'ll have spent a lot of time there. The Prime Minister has done multiple trips. You have toured there a lot and have given big statements too. So, if we look at the whole scene of south India, if we take 129-130 seats, how many seats do you see?\n\nAmit Shah: In south, all four states combined, we will be ahead of Congress.\n\nQ45: How many total seats? Will you\'ll open your account in Kerala and Tamil Nadu?\n\nAmit Shah: We have fought a very good election and will definitely open our account. But estimating the seats there is a problem because there are very close fights.\n\nQ46: But in both the states? You will open your account in Kerala and Tamil Nadu?\n\nAmit Shah: We have an alliance in Andhra Pradesh. We are fighting a very good election. It is just the beginning. We should perform very well in the Lok Sabha polls in Telangana. We could win our highest seats so far from there.\n\nQ48: Amit ji, one more question. Before this election, two CMs have been arrested. Kejriwal ji was arrested -- he is still the Chief Minister. Hemant Soren ji is also in jail. Today the Supreme Court has asked a question to ED on the timing of the arrest. How do you see this?\n\nAmit Shah: ED will explain that before the Supreme Court. But I want to tell you that they did not appear after many summonses. If they had appeared [before the agency] after the first summons, they would have been arrested six months before the elections. Many times summonses were sent, but they did not come.\n\nQ49: Kejriwal ji\'s wife Sunita ji is saying that he is not being given insulin, that he is not being kept there properly, and that this is a conspiracy to kill him.\n\nAmit Shah: Look, Tihar Jail comes under the Delhi government, whose Chief Minister is Kejriwal ji. So is he conspiring to kill himself?\n\nQ52: Supreme Court has ruled on EVMs. Opposition has been talking about EVM for a long time. They always shout slogans that BJP wins elections only because of EVM. Now, you people are talking about ""one nation, one election"". They are talking about EVMs. Will you be able to do this -- ""one nation, one election""?\n\nAmit Shah: I will first clarify one thing: Rahul Gandhi ji does not think about what he says.\n\nIf we won because of EVM, then why did we lose in Telangana, or in Tamil Nadu? Why have we been losing in Kerala for years? Why did we lose in Himachal and Bengal? Then Rahul Gandhi should say it clearly that ""even if we [Congress] win in the outcome shown by EVMs, we will not take oath"". If they win, they take oath wearing new clothes. When they lose, they blame it on EVMs. What kind of politics is this? When you win, EVM is right. When you lose, EVM is useless. Don\'t the people of the country understand all this?\n\nThe people of the country understand this, but I am surprised why such a big party does not change the advisor of its leader. I see from a distance. I am surprised.\n\nWell, forget it, it is their party\'s question. ""One nation, one election"" is the issue of our manifesto, and we will make every effort to implement it.\n\nQ53: So, in next the election in 2029, will there be ""one nation, one election""?\n\nAmit Shah: Parliament has to decide, but Bharatiya Janata Party will definitely try for it.\n\nQ54: Amit ji, let\'s talk about some international issues. Washington Post has published an article in which they have said that R&AW, our intelligence agency, was plotting to kill some terrorists in the US. They have termed this as the dark side of Modi government. You already know about this in Canada...\n\nAmit Shah: One should not think so seriously on basis such media reports. If there is any concrete allegation, the agencies will respond to it. If any government discusses with us through diplomatic methods, we will respond to it.\n\nQ55: In Canada, this was also discussed in context of Nijjar\'s murder.\n\nAmit Shah: I don\'t believe that such allegations in the media raise any serious questions.\n\nQ56: There was another report in the Guardian about India killing 20 terrorists in Pakistan. R&AW using some people to kill them there. Terrorists were killed on Pakistan soil. What would you say about this?\n\nAmit Shah: Who killed is something that has to be found out. But I can say this with certainty that now it\'s established that there are people on Pakistan soil who spread terror in India.\n\nQ57: The Prime Minister is also saying this, many of your senior leaders are also saying it that this India is not the India that will stand and watch the spectacle from the sidelines. This is the India that will enter the house and kill. What are your views on this?\n\nAmit Shah: Definitely. After the surgical strike and air strike, the whole world has understood that India\'s border and the Indian army are not to be messed with. Otherwise, there will be a response.\n\nQ58: Many articles in the western media talk about electoral autocracy, dictatorship, all kinds of things in India. How do you view this? Is there any conspiracy in this, as it\'s been appearing for the last three-four months during election time?\n\nAmit Shah: Leave aside all conspiracies. I am saying this with great pride and confidence that our democracy, our democratic values, and our election; all three are the most transparent in the world, and the most trusted.\n\nQ59: Amit ji, a question on Kashmir. Will BJP contest elections in Kashmir? You have said that you\'ll want to win people\'s hearts there. So, this is a direct question, what will be your answer?\n\nAmit Shah: The party has not decided yet. The party will decide. But traditionally, we have been fighting elections in Jammu.\n\nQ60: Congress is claiming one more thing. They are calling it a murder of democracy. The party is referring to Mukesh Dalal\'s unopposed win in the elections from Surat. This has happened in Indore too.\n\nAmit Shah: See, in our country, 37 people were elected unopposed, and most of them were from Congress. But Congress did not say any of this then. Every party must give tickets to its deserving workers. Congress party forcibly gives tickets to its workers. Sensing a loss, the worker runs away from the battlefield. What can the Bharatiya Janata Party do about this? It is not our job to get their candidates to stay, it is their job.\n\nQ61: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended an anti-India rally, where pro-Khalistan slogans were raised. There were posters of our Prime Minister and some cabinet ministers put up, calling them \'wanted\'. How do you view this?\n\nAmit Shah: Indian government summoned the ambassador of that country (Canada) today and an explanation was also sought from him. We have also expressed our displeasure.\n\nQ63: You have been travelling extensively for the elections. You came here today after visiting three states and have given us so much time. Tomorrow, too, you are travelling to three states. How do you manage such a punishing schedule, when you have been doing it for months?\n\nAmit Shah: I have done this for many years. I did it as a party worker at the lower level. That time there would be visits within state, now there are visits across the country.\n\nQ64: You are known to give the opposition sleepless nights? Do you get time to sleep?\n\nAmit Shah: I never work with a negative mindset. It is my responsibility to secure a win for my party, and if that leads to someone having sleepless nights, then it\'s their problem. Getting my party to win and working for it is my responsibility, and I do it with full dedication.\n\nRahul Joshi: Amit Ji, you took out time and answered all our questions. Thank you for coming here on the banks of Sabarmati and speaking to us. Thank you very much for the conversation.'"

He said that instead of talking about the election manifesto or the work done by the BJP government, PM Modi attacks the Congress party and talks about mangalsutra, mutton and other \'M\' words in his speeches.\n\n""The Prime Minister never talks about the election manifesto. He only abuses the Congress and calls Rahul Gandhi \'shehzada\'. Sometimes he talks about Mughals, sometimes mutton, sometimes Muslim League, sometimes Mangalsutra. Modi ji loves the letter \'M\' a lot,"" he said.\n\nKharge said that both PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah are worried after three phases of Lok Sabha polls. ""Hence they are talking about non-election issues and abusing the Congress. Instead of seeking votes on \'development\', the BJP leaders are distorting their (Congress) leaders\' speeches,"" he said during a press conference.\n\n""After three phases of polls, Modi and Shah saab got worried. They stopped talking about their manifesto, but only are abusing the Congress.

519,519,"b""Mahalakshmi scheme to provide Rs 1 lakh per year to every poor Indian family\n\nThe Congress party's manifesto has promised an ambitious cash transfer of Rs 1 lakh per 'poor' family if voted to power in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. The transfer will go to the oldest woman of the house or the oldest member. The scheme could cost anything between Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 5 lakh crore, according to some back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\nThe Congress party in its manifesto has announced a 'Mahalakshmi scheme' to provide Rs 1 lakh per year to every poor Indian family as an unconditional cash transfer.\n\nThe poor will be identified among the families at the bottom of the income pyramid. The amount will be directly transferred to the bank account of the oldest woman of the household. In families where there is no such woman, the amount will be transferred to the account of the oldest member of the family, according to the party.\n\nThe party says that if voted to power the scheme will be rolled out in stages and reviewed every year to assess the number of beneficiary families and its impact on alleviating poverty.\n\nFiscal math\n\nAccording to the 2011 Socio Economic and Caste Census, there are 24.49 crore (243.9 million) households in India, of which 17.97 crore live in villages. Of these, 10.74 crore households are considered as deprived. Of these 2.38 crore (13.28 percent) households have one or less room, kuccha walls and kuccha roof, 65.33 lakh households (3.64 percent) have no adult member between the age 16 and 59, 69.43 lakh (3.86 percent) are female headed households with no adult male member between 16 and 59 and 7.20 lakh (0.40 percent) are households with differently abled member and no other able bodied adult member. According to the Census, of the deprived households 3.87 crore (21.56 percent) are SC/ST households, 4.22 crore (23.52 percent) are households with no literate adult above age 25 years and 5.40 crore (30.04 percent) are landless households deriving a major part of their income from manual labour.\n\nIf the Congress party decides to spread the Mahalakshmi scheme over five years, it will have to give Rs 1 lakh to at least 2.148 crore families in one year, this is according to the 2011 census data. The amount will vary depending on the number of 'poor families' identified.\n\nA conservative estimate puts the government expenditure at Rs 2.1 lakh crore per annum on the scheme of giving unconditional cash transfers. This number could go up to Rs 5 lakh crore depending on the number of poor families.\n\nFor comparison, the annual budgets of big states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Punjab and Bihar are between Rs 2 lakh crore and Rs 3 lakh crore. India's education budget for the year 2023-24 was Rs 1.12 lakh crore as opposed to Rs 1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23. India's healthcare budget was Rs 79,221 crore in 2023-24.\n\nOne of the primary challenges will be the availability of sufficient funds to sustain the scheme. High financial burdens can strain government budgets, especially if the schemes are not adequately funded or if there are competing priorities for government spending.\n\nExperts say government schemes with high financial burdens need to be financially sustainable in the long term. Ensuring that a scheme's costs are manageable and do not lead to unsustainable fiscal deficits is crucial.\n\nAdministrative challenges\n\nComplex administrative structures or inefficient implementation mechanisms can increase the cost of delivering any such scheme. Ensuring efficient delivery and minimising administrative overheads is essential to manage financial burdens effectively.\n\nIdentifying and targeting beneficiaries accurately is critical to prevent leakage and ensure that resources reach those who need them the most. Poor targeting can result in funds being wasted or misallocated, experts said.\n\nRegular monitoring and evaluation are necessary to assess the effectiveness of any scheme and identify areas for improvement. Investing in robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms can help optimise resource allocation and improve the scheme's impact.\n\nSustaining high financial burdens for government schemes often requires strong political will and commitment. Changes in government priorities or leadership can impact the continuity and funding of such schemes, they said.\n\nEconomic downturns or unforeseen events can affect government revenues and increase pressure on public finances. Adapting to economic fluctuations while maintaining support for essential schemes can be challenging.\n\nPublic perception and support for a scheme can influence its funding and sustainability. Building and maintaining public trust through transparent communication and demonstrating a scheme's benefits are crucial for its long-term success.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires careful planning, effective governance, and continuous monitoring to ensure that government schemes with high financial burdens fulfil their intended objectives while remaining financially viable and sustainable."""
520,520,"b'The Thiruvananthapuram MP doubled down on his party\'s charge that the NDA is seeking 400 seats because it wants to change the Constitution.\n\nMr Tharoor said the Congress spoke of an X-Ray as a diagnosis.\n\nHitting back hard at the BJP\'s allegations that his party\'s manifesto speaks about wealth redistribution and an inheritance tax, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said that the ruling party is talking about the document even without reading it and every charge levelled on this front is ""completely concocted by its propaganda machinery"".\n\nSpeaking exclusively to NDTV on Wednesday, the three-time MP and candidate from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency also doubled down on his party\'s charge that the NDA is seeking 400 seats because it wants to change the Constitution, his differences with Hindutva and how the BJP has hit a ceiling in terms of its vote share in Kerala.\n\nThe BJP, led from the front by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been consistently saying that the Congress manifesto speaks about taking people\'s money and jewellery, including \'mangalsutras\' - a sacred ornament in Hinduism symbolising that a woman is married. On some occasions, the PM also said that the Congress will conduct an X-Ray of people\'s homes to get to their possessions and that these will then be redistributed, including among Muslims.\n\nWhen Mr Tharoor - who was also part of the manifesto committee - was asked about this, he rubbished the allegations and said there is no mention of wealth redistribution or an inheritance tax in the document.\n\n""Where is the word economic redistribution in the manifesto? I am on the manifesto committee, there is no such phrase in the manifesto. Every charge the BJP has applied is completely concocted by the BJP\'s propaganda machinery. They have talked about people snatching gold and \'mangalsutras\'. There is no reference to any of this. They have talked about the inheritance tax. There is no reference to any of this. None of these issues are even discussed, by the way, in the manifesto committee,"" Mr Tharoor\n\nThe MP conceded that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had spoken about an X-Ray but said that didn\'t mean going to people\'s houses and checking their cupboards. The X-Ray, or socio-economic caste Census, is to reveal what\'s going on inside our country. This, he said, is important because every state government and central government gives or withholds benefits depending on caste.\n\nThe socio-economic caste census, he said, will help correlate what people are earning with their caste affiliation. If a correlation emerges between Dalits and poverty, for example, he said, the government can have targeted policies.\n\n""My argument with all of this is that this is a process that will have to be embarked upon. It is not, at this stage anything more than a diagnosis, an X-Ray is used for diagnosis. The prescription has not been made until you\'ve done the diagnosis. Why is the BJP inventing an imaginary prescription of wealth redistribution and ascribing it to the Congress... If you object to the diagnosis, tell us why,"" he said.\n\n\'No Religious Quota At National Level\'\n\nOn the Prime Minister asking the Congress to declare there will be no quota for Muslims based on religion, the senior leader said the manifesto is at the national level and, at that level, there has never been a quota based on religion for any community. He said some states, like Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, have classified Muslims in some categories as other backward classes (OBC).\n\n""That is something that has been non-controversial in those states. Why the Prime Minister wants to make a bogey of it, we don\'t know, because this is a national election, it is not a state Assembly election... But this is not a federal policy, not a Union government policy. And our manifesto is written for the Union government. We have not mentioned this anywhere,"" he emphasised.\n\nChange Without Consensus?\n\nJoining his party\'s attack on the BJP\'s ""ab ki baar 400 paar"" slogan being a ploy to amend the Constitution by getting 400 seats for the NDA, Mr Tharoor claimed four candidates from the alliance have said as much on different occasions. He said all constitutional amendments so far have been consensus-driven and such a big number is not needed for that.\n\nClaiming that the figure is a fantasy now and the BJP has stopped talking about it, he said 400 would only be needed if the BJP intended to do things no one else in the Lok Sabha would agree to.\n\nPointing to the alleged ""weaponisation"" of central agencies and ""whitewashing"" of those who have joined the BJP, among other examples, the Congress leader said, ""What is more worrying to me right now is that they (the BJP) have been violating the spirit of the Constitution already, while seemingly adhering to the letter of it.""\n\n\'Vote Share Not Increasing In Kerala\'\n\nAddressing talk of the BJP doing better in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the party has been making a concerted push, Mr Tharoor said its vote share in his state has not been steadily increasing.\n\n""They went from being about a two or three per cent party at the beginning of the century to about 12-13 per cent party in 2014, and they have stayed at that level because taking the state as a whole, averaging it all out, it comes to 12-13 per cent in 2014 and 2019. I don\'t think it will be much better in 2024,"" the Congress leader said.\n\n""If you were to look at individual constituencies, which is probably arguably the strongest constituency in Kerala, where they have come second twice, they hit their peak at 31 per cent. In fact, I think they were 32 per cent in 2014 and 31 per cent in 2019, which is down, and they are certainly going down from that in 2024. So I think the BJP has hit the limits of its appeal in Kerala largely because we are a society that has been, so far, immune to this communalism contagion,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP argued.\n\n\'Opposed To Hindutva\'\n\nMr Tharoor claimed this BJP government is the first in the history of Independent India that has not had a single Muslim MP in either house throughout this term and has not had even one Muslim minister for any portfolio. ""Even the minority portfolio is being handled by somebody from the majority community now,"" he said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAs a practising Hindu, the Congress leader said he is opposed to the political doctrine of Hindutva. ""What is sad to me is that people are showing intolerance and bigotry in the name of a faith that is anything but intolerant and bigoted. So my critique of Hindutva is from within Hinduism,"" he said.\n\nThe MP also said that it is not true that senior Congress leaders don\'t want to contest Lok Sabha polls and that the criteria for giving tickets has been winnability.'"
521,521,"b'A lawyer by profession, Anand Sharma was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1984\n\nFormer Union Minister Anand Sharma is the Congress candidate for the Kangra Lok Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh. Mr Sharma, first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1984, is contesting his debut Lok Sabha elections this year.\n\nHere are some facts on Anand Sharma:\n\n1. Anand Sharma was born on January 5, 1953, in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh to PA Sharma and Prabha Rani Sharma. He completed his BA from Shimla\'s RPC SDB College in 1973 before earning his Bachelor of Law from Himachal Pradesh University in 1977.\n\n2. Mr Sharma was always interested in politics and participated in student and youth movements across India. He was one of the founding members of the National Student Union Of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress. He later served as its state President for Himachal Pradesh and National General Secretary. In 1985, Mr Sharma became the president of the Indian Youth Congress.\n\n3. Anand Sharma made his electoral debut in 1982 when he unsuccessfully contested the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections against BJP\'s Daulat Ram Chauhan. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1984 at age 31, after which he served four terms.\n\n4. In his four-decade-long career, Mr Sharma worked closely with former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and was a Union Minister in the Manmohan Singh government. In 2006, he became the Union Minister of Foreign Affairs and then Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting in 2008. He was also the Congress party\'s chief spokesperson for six years. Mr Sharma was the deputy leader of Congress in the Rajya Sabha before he retired in 2022.\n\n5. A Lok Sabha ticket to Mr Sharma came as a surprise to many because he was a prominent member of ""Group of 23"" (G-23) Congress leaders, who, back in 2020, wrote to then-party chief Sonia Gandhi and asked for a ""collective and inclusive leadership"" in the organisation.

522,522,"b'Rahul Gandhi today addressed a poll rally at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh today\n\nRatlam (MP):\n\nThe Congress will remove the Supreme Court-mandated 50 per cent cap on caste-based reservation and increase quota benefits for people from Dalit, backward and tribal communities, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said today.\n\nAddressing a poll rally at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, Mr Gandhi said this election is being fought to save the Constitution. ""BJP and RSS want to finish this, change this. And the Congress and INDIA bloc are trying to save this. This Constitution has given you rights on jal (water), jangal (forest), zameen (land). Narendra Modi wants to remove them, he wants full power,"" he said, holding a copy of the Constitution.\n\nThe BJP leaders, he said, had declared that they would change the Constitution if they win. ""That\'s why they gave the \'400 seats\' slogan. But forget 400, they are not getting 150 seats. They say they will remove reservation. I want to tell you from this stage, we will increase reservation beyond the 50 per cent cap. We will give as much reservation as needed for the poor, the backwards, Dalits and adivasis,"" he said.\n\nMr Gandhi\'s remarks come amid a high-pitched campaign for the Lok Sabha polls and heated exchanges between the NDA and the INDIA bloc on reservation.\n\nThe BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has alleged that the Congress plans to tinker with the reservation for backward classes to benefit Muslims. The Congress has denied the allegations. At a rally in Gujarat Banaskantha, the Prime Minister said, ""I challenge the \'shehzada\' of the Congress as well as his party and its supporters to announce they will never misuse reservation in the name of religion, nor will they play with the Constitution or grant reservation in the name of religion.""\n\nAt the Ratlam rally, Mr Gandhi said the media does not show news related to atrocities on Adivasis. ""Your children are raped, your land is snatched, but media does not report. There is a reason. There are no Adivasis in these media companies,"" he said.\n\nMr Gandhi said 90 bureaucrats run the country\'s government. ""They distribute the budgets. Only 1 out of the 90 is an Adivasis, three are from backward classes, three from the Dalit community. Your people are neither in the media nor the corporate world. We want to change this. This is why we have decided to carry out a caste Census and an economic survey,"" he said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nMr Gandhi also assured farmers relief in the form of assured MSP and loan waivers. ""These are our guarantees. They will change your life,"" he told the crowd.\n\nRatlam votes on May 13 in the fourth phase of Lok Sabha election. The Congress has fielded former MP and former Union Minister Kantilal Bhuria. Anita Nagar Singh Chauhan is the BJP\'s pick from the seat they won in the 2019 election.'"
523,523,"b""Telangana, the second of the two Telugu-speaking states, heads to the polls on May 13, offering the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) another chance to send representatives from Southern India to the 18th Lok Sabha. Beyond its southern stronghold of Karnataka, the BJP secured an impressive four out of the total 17 seats in Telangana in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This was achieved by finishing as a runner-up and limiting the regional Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS, formerly Telangana Rashtra Samiti) to a single-digit tally, thus limiting the party's grip on the state since the formation of Telangana in 2014.\n\nAfter a setback in the December 2023 assembly elections, the BJP has re-emerged as the principal challenger to the Congress party, which secured the mandate to govern the state under the leadership of Chief Minister Revanth Reddy. Conversely, after facing rejection by the people and concluding a decade-long tenure in office, the BRS and its leader, K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR), are hoping to regain some of their lost prestige in Telangana. Effectively, the contest for the 17 seats should be seen as triangular, though with few exceptions - especially the high-profile Hyderabad constituency.\n\nAdvantage Incumbency?\n\nRevanth Reddy, who led the Congress party to victory in the December assembly elections, faces the test of delivering and raising his party's Lok Sabha tally in the state from the current three. The Congress campaign spotlight is on the party's commitment to implementing the five guarantees. Despite financial constraints, the state government has managed to fulfil four of the six guarantees it promised.\n\nAmong the schemes that have gained traction is the free bus ride programme for women. According to official estimates, approximately 30 lakh beneficiaries avail of this facility every month, resulting in an estimated saving of Rs 1,150 crore for women since the scheme's implementation in December. The free bus travel experience may also be expanded with the Indian National Congress promising 'Nari Nyay', under which it will provide Rs 1 Lakh annually for women belonging to poorer sections. There are four other promises on offer: Rs 1 lakh for educated youth through employment opportunities, loan waiver for farmers, Rs 400 per day minimum wage, and a caste census for better targeting of welfare schemes.\n\nRead | In Telangana, KCR's Leaders Swell Congress, BJP Ranks Ahead of Polls\n\nNot limiting itself to mere delivery and promises, the Congress has also not shied away from fielding candidates who defected from other parties. Among them are Ranjit Reddy, Danam Nagender, and P. Dayakar, all of whom underwent a Ghar Wapasi (homecoming). Conversely, the BJP has imported candidates from the BRS.\n\nBJP's Strategy\n\nAfter the loss of momentum it witnessed during the assembly polls under its former state chief Bandi Sanjay, the BJP is now striving to bolster its national campaign to make way for a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Unlike in 2014, when the state voted as a single entity and gave a majority of the nine seats to the BRS, the BJP's objective now is to secure seats in double digits.\n\nA concerted effort to build on its nearly 20% vote share in 2019 has seen the BJP leadership, including PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, dedicating time to campaign for party candidates. In addition to emphasising issues such as the Congress's alleged favouring of minorities at the expense of others, campaigners are out to confront the perception that the Abki Baar 400-paar slogan signifies an intention to alter the Constitution and abolish reservations for Scheduled Castes/Tribes. As a rebuttal, the campaign is focusing on 'Modi ki Guarantee' (Modi's guarantee), highlighting how welfare schemes have benefited all without discrimination.\n\nBRS's Challenges\n\nFor former chief minister KCR, who was a staunch advocate of a separate state, the Lok Sabha polls present an opportunity to remind the people of his contributions. In addition to his son K.T. Rama Rao and nephew T. Harish Rao, BRS leaders are working to energise their cadres even as K. Kavitha, KCR's daughter, remains in custody for an alleged involvement in the Delhi liquor scam.\n\nRead | Opinion: The Remarkable Congress Turnaround In Telangana\n\nThe current elections come just five months after the assembly polls, and the BRS is hoping that public anger against it must have subsided by now, allowing it to gradually regain its influence. However, the flip side is that people also recognise the limited role the BRS would have in Delhi given its relationships with the two key national parties, the BJP and the Congress.\n\nHyderabad: A Charminar Contest\n\nWith significant portions of the old city constituting part of the Hyderabad seat, the area is poised for a quadrangular contest. Sitting MP Asaduddin Owaisi of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) will be defending the seat - previously held by his father Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi - for a fifth term.\n\nOwaisi, who secured nearly 59% votes last time, is being challenged by the BJP through a debutant businesswoman and social worker, Kompella Madhavi Latha. The Congress, meanwhile, has fielded Mohammed Wallullah Sameer, and Gaddam Srinivas Yadav is the BRS candidate there.\n\nNow, it's over to the 3.3 crore-strong electorate of Telangana.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(K.V.

You cannot hide the system from me,"" he said.\n\nMr Gandhi claimed that as he has ""come from inside the system"", he knows how it runs, whom it favours, in what way it favours, whom it protects and whom it attacks.\n\n""In the prime minister house, when my grandmother and later father were PM and later Dr Manmohan Singh, I used to go, so I know the system from inside.

There used to be public sector earlier but the BJP finished it. Then was the railways which is also facing the same fate. Now they brought Agniveer scheme in the Army.\n\nRahul Gandhi said the BJP and the RSS are thinking that they have won this battle. ""But they do not realise that they are going to lose it,"" he said.\n\nBatting for caste census, he said through it, the exact number of OBCs, tribals, Dalits and minorities will be known, he stated.\n\n""All our institutions, be it the judiciary or media, we have to conduct a survey that how much power the 90 per cent (population) has in these institutions, which position they hold and how many of them are there,"" he added.\n\n""Economic financial survey (to know) who holds how much of the country\'s resources.

He says we will steal your wealth and give it to those who have more children. Poor people always have more children. Do only Muslims have them?"" he asked.\n\nHe himself has five children but he was the only son of his parents, the Congress president said, adding that his mother, sister and uncle died when their house was set on fire.\n\nOnly his father and he were left, and ""My father told me I am his only son and he wanted to see my children,"" Mr Kharge said.\n\n""Poor people have (more) children as they do not have wealth. But why do you (Modi) only keep talking about Muslims? Muslims belong to this country,"" he said, asking people not to get misled as ""we have to build the country by taking everyone together, not like them (BJP) by breaking it.""\n\nDuring an election rally in Rajasthan, PM Modi had said that if Congress came to power it would redistribute people\'s wealth to those who have more children and to the infiltrators. He had also cited former prime minister Manmohan Singh\'s remark that Muslims had the first claim on the country\'s resources.\n\nOn PM Modi\'s claim that Congress was planning to seize people\'s wealth including even women\'s mangalsutra, Mr Kharge asked, ""We ruled the country for 55 years, but did we snatch anyone\'s \'mangalsutra\' or misuse the ED (Enforcement Directorate), IT (Income Tax) to put people behind bars?""\n\nThe prime minister was speaking lies and misleading people, he alleged, claiming that PM Modi speaks about ""Hindu-Muslim"" (issues) even where Muslims have zero presence.\n\n""Nowadays he is saying Congress wants to do an X-ray of gold in every house and land and it will not leave even your \'mangalsutra\'. We have said we want to conduct a caste census to assess the conditions of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and backward classes so that their situation can be improved, but he made fun of it,"" Mr Kharge said.\n\nIf such a prime minister ruled for five more years, the country would be destroyed, the Congress president said.\n\n""He (Modi) says \'sabka sath, sabka vikas\'. He takes the support of everyone but never does their \'vikas\' (development). He does their \'satyanash\' (destruction). He implemented demonetisation and did not support anyone during the Covid (epidemic),"" Mr Kharge added.\n\nThose who were given ""injections"" (apparently referring to vaccines) during the COVID-19 epidemic were still facing health problems, and laboratories have reported that heart attack cases increased in India as a result of some defect in the medicine, but the Union government does not have any answer on this issue, Mr Kharge claimed.\n\n""This election is being fought to keep India united and save the Constitution and democracy. Modi and his followers say, again and again, give us a 400-plus figure. They are seeking 400-plus seats not for the welfare of the poor, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and backward people...They are seeking it to take away the poor people\'s rights,"" he alleged.\n\nThe Congress veteran also asked why RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had to clarify that they were not going to change the Constitution or end reservations if some BJP leader had not talked about such plans earlier.\n\n""He (Modi) compares (himself) with former prime ministers Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Rajiv Gandhi.

The Reserve Bank of India may continue to prevent any sharp swings in the currency by absorbing inflows, he said.\n\nIndia\'s bond market is likely to see additional inflows of as much as $30 billion after the nation\'s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s emerging market index starting in June. The flows will test the RBI\'s tight grip on the rupee that helped limit volatility in the currency and aided the nation\'s export competitiveness.\n\nEven though the currency touched a record low of 83.58 against the dollar in April, it has outperformed emerging Asia peers this year, boosting its appeal for investors.\n\nWhat India\'s Addition to JPMorgan\'s Bond Index Means: QuickTake\n\n""India does seem pretty well poised with bond index inclusion and flows that should be coming in the second half of the year,"" said Zook, who has worked at the US Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund in the past. ""The RBI has large external reserve buffers and a modest current-account deficit at this point in time.""\n\nFitch\'s estimate for the rupee is stronger than the median estimate of 83 per dollar in a Bloomberg survey. A shrinking trade deficit and limited impact on crude oil prices from the conflict in the Middle East are in favor of the currency.\n\nTo shield the nation from hot money flows, the RBI has built one of the largest stockpiles of foreign exchange in the world. A widely anticipated win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the ongoing national polls is also bolstering the case for inflows.\n\n""Even if there is an oil price shock, India has the buffers to manage some of those risks,"" said Zook.

539,539,"b'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Elon Musk\'s carmaker Tesla has sued an Indian battery maker for infringing its trademark by using the brand name ""Tesla Power"" to promote its products, seeking damages and a permanent injunction against the company from a New Delhi judge.\n\nTesla in a hearing at the Delhi High Court this week said the Indian company had continued advertising its products with the ""Tesla Power"" brand despite a cease-and-desist notice sent in April 2022, according to details of the proceedings posted on the court website on Friday.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Indian company, Tesla Power India Pvt Ltd, argued its main business is to make ""lead acid batteries"" and it has no intention of making electric vehicles.\n\nThe judge allowed the Indian firm three weeks to submit written responses after it handed over a set of documents in support of its defence, the court record shows.\n\nMusk\'s Tesla is incorporated in Delaware, and it has accused the Indian company of using trade names ""Tesla Power"" and ""Tesla Power USA"".

540,540,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Early each morning in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar, wholesaler Gadadhara Mohanty waits anxiously for trucks carrying bananas to a food market from a few hundred kilometers away. With no refrigeration in his storeroom, a single-day delay in selling the bananas can reduce the value of his stockpile by at least 10%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhen they arrive, he will sort through bushels and inspect the skins for signs of decay.\n\n""There\'s a huge loss during summer months if the sales lag,"" he said.\n\nThis is no small problem for India, where as much as 15% of fruits and vegetables are lost after harvesting, despite still-persistent malnutrition and hunger. The spoiled food comes down largely to poor infrastructure. Most farmers here are small producers who can\'t invest heavily in cooling and refrigeration along the supply chain. In addition, India wastes nearly 80 million tons of food at the retail and consumer level, second only to China. As climate changes exacerbates extreme heat, the numbers are likely to worsen in South Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions to rising temperatures.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has modernized much of India\'s infrastructure, but farmers say progress in their sector lags others. Though production of grains, fruits and vegetables is increasing, refrigeration is still inadequate across the supply chain. Outside of urban areas, storage, transportation and retail distribution are slowed by India\'s rutted roads and the distance between farms and wholesale markets. In turn, spoilage during transit adds to the cost of procurement, pushing up consumer prices -- a major concern during India\'s election, which wraps up next month. Compared to grain, which can be stored for months or years, produce\'s short shelf life makes it harder to hedge.\n\nTake bananas. To reach wholesale markets in Bhubaneswar, in eastern India, trucks travel nearly 24 hours from farms in the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh. India is the world\'s largest producer of bananas, which are highly perishable. To keep fruit cool on the journey, they\'re covered with leaves during transit. It\'s far from a solution: India lost 1.53 trillion rupees ($18.4 billion) of food in fiscal year 2020-21, about a fifth of that from spoilt fruit.\n\n""The cold storage capacity hasn\'t done justice to the small-holder farmers of our country,"" said Pawanexh Kohli, former chief of the state-run National Centre for Cold-Chain Development. ""They are forced to make distress sales.""\n\nSoaring temperatures are raising the stakes for India\'s farmers. In Andhra Pradesh, cultivators say they\'re losing a greater number of crops from extreme weather. Each spoiled bunch, or about 80 to 130 bananas, is a substantial financial setback, with farmers missing out on as much as 150 rupees for each grouping. Rising costs for farm inputs such as fertilizers further squeeze already tight margins.\n\nVenkatanaidu Guntreddi, 50, who grows bananas across 150 acres (61 hectares) of land, doesn\'t see affordable remedies. Andhra Pradesh\'s maximum temperature in 2023 was the second-highest on record since 1901. Guntreddi figures that a cold storage facility would help prolong the shelf life of his produce, but it\'s not something he can afford.\n\n""There is no profit in cultivation because brokers make most of the money and we are hit by extreme weather,"" Guntreddi said, pointing to withered banana plants on a tour of his farm in the village of Parajapadu. He urged the local authorities to help farmers set up processing units to make products such as banana chips and wine -- avenues that would cut losses from crops destroyed by the heat.\n\nIndia has cold storage capacity of more than 30 million tons. The refrigerators are largely used by wholesalers and retailers for potatoes, a staple in almost every Indian meal. What the country lacks is an adequate number of refrigerated trucks and pack-houses, facilities used to keep fruits and vegetables cool right after they\'re harvested.\n\nCrossing some of the region\'s major banana growing areas, farmers say they\'re always in a hurry to immediately offload fresh fruits and vegetables because they don\'t often have access to pack-houses, which tend to be far from their plots. In turn, they\'re forced to sell crops at whatever prices brokers and traders offer. India provides a subsidy of 35% to 50% to set up storage facilities, including pack-houses, according to the food processing ministry. Aid for frozen storage infrastructure is slightly higher. But many say even with those incentives, the costs are still too high.\n\nSiraj Hussain, a former farm secretary, said investors are also put off from modernizing infrastructure because most food is sold informally by street vendors and small shops. ""Large investment in the food chain is not considered profitable,"" he said.\n\nAnita Praveen, secretary at India\'s Ministry of Food Processing Industries, didn\'t reply to requests for comment for this story.\n\nOn a recent day, Bhanu Rokkam, 32, a banana farmer from Thotapalli, in Andhra Pradesh, began harvesting at dawn to evade the scorching sun. It took him nearly four hours to gather around 250 bunches. A pair of brothers, acting as brokers, purchased the fruits from Rokkam, offering an average of 200 to 220 rupees per bunch, excluding transportation expenses. That range is about 12% less than what Rokkam might expect during the cooler months. He said brokers use the hot weather to their advantage.\n\nIn the neighboring state of Odisha, retailers are also constrained by the lack of cold storage infrastructure, leading them to only purchase the amount of fruit they can sell on the same day. This limitation affects their ability to stockpile and sometimes impacts availability. Consumers bear the brunt of supply chain losses, as costs incurred throughout the chain are passed on, resulting in higher fruit prices.\n\nMahadev Barik, a street vendor in Bhubaneswar, sells more than one thousand bananas every day. His losses sometimes climb to as much as 30% when the heat is so bad that he\'s forced to sell below the purchase rate. With temperatures this extreme, he now takes his cart out in the evenings.'"

Volatility in the shorter tenor has risen steadily since the elections kicked off last month.\n\nA lower-than-expected voter turnout in India\'s elections has led to some consternation about the prospects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party which is widely expected to win a third successive term.

For a similar drop in the US debt, Indian bond yields fell by 0.32 basis points.\n\n""India is benefiting from a very positive domestic story,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of FX and EM macro strategy for Asia at Barclays Plc, citing the upcoming index inclusion, fiscal prudence and rupee stability. ""These factors will attract growing portfolio inflows to India.""\n\nThe relative stability of Indian bonds is adding to the optimism toward local assets. India\'s foreign-exchange reserves hit a record high in April, and the rupee has remained emerging Asia\'s best performing currency even against a strong dollar, reflecting increased investor interest.\n\nSince JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s announcement in September, global funds have poured $8 billion into so-called Fully Accessible Route securities, with Standard Chartered Plc. forecasting an additional inflow of up to $30 billion upon the start of India\'s inclusion in June.\n\nChina\'s bonds show the least reaction to US notes among emerging Asia due to tighter control. However, investors may still prefer India\'s debt thanks to the rupee\'s low volatility.\n\nOther Asian currencies and bonds are more vulnerable to the swings in the yen and yuan due to stronger trade linkages and thinner spread over Treasuries. South Korean bonds are the most sensitive to Treasury moves, according to the Bloomberg analysis of scenarios where the US yield climbed or fell by more than 30 basis points over a 10-day period.\n\nThe rupee and peso are the least sensitive Asian currencies to both the dollar-yuan and the dollar-yen, while won and the ringgit are the most vulnerable, Goldman Sachs strategists including Danny Suwanapruti wrote in a note.\n\nIndia\'s bonds have also been helped by the government\'s programs of reforms and fiscal restraint. Investors are now focused on the ongoing national polls, where a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi may further bolster the appeal of local assets.\n\n""The Indian election feels like it should be one of the lower volatility political events this year,"" said Paul Greer, a money manager at Fidelity International in London.

At least 10 companies are weighing offerings of more than $100 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nA flurry of small deals has made India one of Asia\'s busiest IPO markets this year. Bigger share sales brighten the nation\'s chances of attracting global funds as investors rotate money amid a patchy recovery in China. A mix of factors is behind the exuberance -- stocks are scaling new heights, economic growth is solid and earnings are beating estimates.\n\nAt the start of the year, ""we saw a lot of smaller IPOs coming to market, not large ones. What we are seeing is a big shift in this trend with average IPO sizes going up meaningfully,"" said Jibi Jacob, the head of equity capital markets for Jefferies in India.\n\nThe timing to go public is also influenced by India\'s ongoing elections. The poll outcome on June 4 will give a clear picture of political stability and policy continuity, removing any lingering uncertainty for companies.\n\nPotential issuers include e-commerce startup BrainBees Solutions Ltd., which retails baby products under the brand name FirstCry.com, hypermarket operator Vishal Mega Mart, and SoftBank Group Corp.-backed ANI Technologies, which is the operator of ride-hailing app Ola Cabs. Hyundai Motor Co. is also exploring the listing of its India unit that may raise about $2.5 billion.\n\nThe performance of recent mid-size debuts is also boosting sentiment.

The so-called fear gauge, which hit a record low just two weeks ago, is now approaching its highest close since early 2023.\n\nModi is still widely expected to win a third five-year term in the marathon election that began April 19 and will run through June 1, with the leader having predicted that his Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies will win more than 400 of the 543 seats up for grabs in the lower house of parliament.\n\nHowever, attention has recently shifted to a dip in voter turnout during the first two phases of voting and media reports have fanned some speculation among equity traders of a less emphatic performance for the ruling coalition. In the last election in 2019, the BJP expanded its majority to 303 seats, and the alliance it leads currently commands 353 seats.\n\n""There is a chatter that BJP may win 290-300 seats and if that happens, markets will surely see a blip,"" said Mukesh Jain, managing director of Jaipur-based Maverick Share Brokers Pvt, which has been tracking the markets for over two decades.\n\nIndia\'s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid as much as 0.9% in a third day of declines on Tuesday, heading for its lowest close since April 19. That\'s even as a broader gauge of Asian stocks advanced for a fourth day. Turnover in equity derivatives has also slumped to its lowest since December.\n\nLast week, the Election Commission of India said it was disappointed with the turnout so far and is taking measures to boost participation in the remaining phases of polling. On Tuesday, voting kicked off in Modi\'s home state of Gujarat in what is the third phase of the election. The winner will be declared on June 4.

546,546,"b'In January, thousands braved the freezing cold at Delhi\'s Red Fort to hear Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak.\n\nHis message was ""Viksit Bharat 2047"", a promise to make India a developed nation by 2047.\n\nIt\'s the latest catchphrase from a man known for his penchant for catchy taglines.\n\n""Developed India"" is an imprecise pledge, but in the 10 years since Mr Modi first stormed to power, he has been trying to lay the foundations for a period of economic boom.\n\nThe prime minister and his government inherited an economy that was teetering on the precipice. Growth was slowing and investor confidence was low. A dozen Indian billionaires had gone bankrupt, saddling the country\'s banks with enormous unpaid loans that had crippled their capacity to lend.\n\nNow, 10 years on, India\'s growth is outpacing other major economies, its banks are strong, and the government\'s finances are stable despite a painful pandemic. India surpassed the UK as the fifth largest economy last year and according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, it\'s on track to overtake Japan and Germany and hit the third spot by 2027.\n\nThere is undoubtedly an air of optimism in the country. It successfully hosted the G20, became the first to send a rocket near the Moon\'s south pole, and has birthed a few dozen unicorns. The soaring stock markets have also had a trickle-down effect on the wealth of its middle class.\n\nOn the face of it ""Modinomics"" - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\'s economic vision for India - appears to be working. But dig deeper, and the picture is more complex. For a vast swathe of the country\'s 1.4 billion people who live on the margins of sustenance, it\'s not boomtime just as yet.\n\nMr Modi\'s push for digital governance has begun to transform the lives of some of the country\'s poorest people.\n\nToday, Indians in the remotest corners of the country can buy many daily goods without cash, paying as little as 20p for a packet of bread using a QR code on their phone.\n\nUnderpinning this digital revolution is a three-layer system of governance, which includes universal identity cards, a payments infrastructure that enables click-of-a-button money transfer, and a data pillar that gives people access to crucial personal documents like tax returns.\n\nLinking hundreds of millions of bank accounts to this ""digital stack"" has cut red tape and corruption.\n\nEstimates suggest that up to March 2021, an equivalent of about 1.1% of GDP was saved due to digital governance, allowing the government to dole out a volley of social subsidies, cash handouts and also spend on infrastructure building, without running high deficits.\n\nCranes, cranes everywhere!\n\nEverywhere you go in India there are cranes and JCB machines at work giving its creaky public infrastructure a shiny makeover.\n\nTake a look at this slick first underwater metro in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.\n\nThere\'s no doubt this country is getting a facelift.\n\nBuilding new roads, airports, ports and metros has been the centrepiece of Mr Modi\'s economic policy. He spent over $100bn annually in infrastructure spending (capital expenditure) in the past three years.\n\nNearly 54,000 km (33,554 miles) of national highways were built between 2014 and 2024 - which is twice the length of the preceding 10 years.\n\nThe government has also considerably eased up the bureaucracy, which has been a major bugbear of India\'s economy for decades.\n\nBut Mr Modi\'s policies haven\'t delivered for all.\n\nThe brutal lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, the lingering after-effects of a cash ban in 2016, and faulty implementation of a new goods and services tax - a long pending reform meant to streamline the country\'s welter of indirect taxes - have had far-reaching structural consequences on India\'s economy.\n\nThe country\'s vast unorganised sector - small enterprises that form the backbone of this country - are still reeling under the impact of some of these decisions.\n\nAnd the private sector is not committing big investments. As a proportion of GDP, private investments slumped to barely 19.6% in 2020-21 from a peak of 27.5% in 2007-08.\n\nJobs blues\n\nIn January, thousands gathered outside government recruitment centres in the northern city of Lucknow to go to Israel for jobs in the construction industry. My colleague Archana Shukla was on location.\n\nThe desperation of these workers showed India\'s jobs crisis is real. And it is crushing aspirations everywhere.\n\n""I\'m the first master\'s degree holder in my family,"" says Rukaiya Bepari, a 23-year-old graduate in the town of Miraj in western India.\n\n""But there\'s no industry where I live. So I\'m now taking tuitions. It doesn\'t pay much.""\n\nNeither Rukaiya nor her brother have had full-time work for the last two years. They\'re not alone.\n\nUnemployment among educated youth has doubled from 35.2% to 65.7% between 2000 and 2022, according to latest figures by the Indian Labour Organization, a human rights group.\n\nThere\'s also been no significant growth of real wages in India since 2014, according to numbers computed by noted developmental economist Jean Dreze.\n\nIndia ""risks squandering its demographic dividend"" - the economic growth potential from a big working-age population - the World Bank\'s regional economist said in an interview to the Financial Times recently.\n\nJob creation is a problem Mr Modi has been unable to solve.\n\nRight off the back of his victory in 2014, the prime minister launched an ambitious Make In India campaign to turn India into the world\'s factory. In 2020, his government doled out $25bn in incentives to companies across sectors from semi-conductors to mobile electronics in order to enhance India\'s manufacturing capabilities.\n\nBut success has been elusive.\n\nYes, the likes of Foxconn - which makes iPhones for Apple - are moving their supply chains to India as part of the global ""China plus one"" diversification strategy. Other major global giants like Micron and Samsung have also been enthused to invest. But the numbers are not significant yet.\n\nManufacturing\'s share as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant in the last decade despite these efforts.\n\nGrowth in exports was also faster under Mr Modi\'s predecessors.\n\n""Even if India\'s manufacturing grows 8% per year till 2050 and China\'s stagnates at the 2022 level, India\'s manufacturing size in 2050 will still not match that of China\'s in 2022,"" says Prof Vidya Mahambare of the Great Lakes Institute of Management.\n\nLack of a large scale industry means half of India\'s population still depends on agriculture for their livelihoods - which is increasingly becoming unprofitable.\n\nTwo speed recovery\n\nA direct impact of this? Squeezed household budgets.\n\nAt 3%, the growth in overall private consumption expenditure - the money people spend on buying things - is the slowest in 20 years.\n\nAnd household debt has touched an all-time high, even as financial savings plunged to their lowest levels, according to new research.\n\nMany economists argue that the nature of India\'s economic growth post pandemic has been uneven, or ""K-shaped"" - where the rich have thrived, while the poor continue to struggle. India may be the fifth largest global economy at an aggregate level, but on a per person basis, it still languishes at the 140th rank.\n\nAnd inequality has widened to a hundred-year high according to research from the World Inequality Database. No surprises then that election campaign discourse recently has been rife with chatter around wealth redistribution and inheritance taxes.\n\nA three day pre-wedding ceremony of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani\'s son recently offered a glimpse into the country\'s new gilded age. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump were in attendance. Rihanna shook a leg with Bollywood\'s biggest celebrities, while the Ambani women flashed diamonds and jewellery once part of the Mughal empire\'s collection.\n\nLuxury brands making cars, watches and liquor have been growing faster than India\'s more mass-market companies, according to Arnab Mitra, who researches Indian consumer brands at Goldman Sachs.\n\nViral Acharya, a professor at NYU Stern, says a handful of the biggest conglomerates have grown ""at the expense of the smallest firms"".\n\nThe super-rich, he says, have benefited from sharp tax cuts and a conscious policy of creating ""national champions"" in which prized public assets like ports and airports have been preferentially given to a few companies to build or run.\n\nLatest court revelations show many of them have also been India\'s top political donors to the ruling BJP.\n\nIndia\'s decade?\n\nAll combined, this presents an inconsistent picture of India\'s economy. But for all its problems, the country is on the runway for take-off, say experts.\n\n""India\'s next decade could resemble China\'s path (of hyper growth) from 2007 through 2012,"" analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a widely discussed paper.\n\nThey add that the country has many advantages - a young demographic, the geopolitics of global de-risking from China and a clean-up of sectors like real estate. Other megatrends like digitalisation, a transition to clean energy and growth in global offshoring will propel future growth, say experts.\n\nThe infra push is also something that will have long-term payoffs. By making improvements in roads, power supply and turnaround time at ports - India is finally ""creating an environment in which manufacturing can flourish"", says DK Joshi, CRISIL\'s India economist.\n\nBut along with the focus on ""physical capital"", Mr Modi needs to pay heed to creating ""human capital"", says Dr Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of India\'s central bank.\n\nIndian children aren\'t learning as well as they should to face up to the world of artificial intelligence. A quarter of those aged 14 to 18 can\'t read simple text fluently, according to a report published by the non-profit Pratham Foundation.\n\nCovid-19 dealt a major blow to students, who couldn\'t attend school for nearly two years. But the government has continued to underfund education, and healthcare.\n\nIn its first decade, Modinomics appears to have delivered for a select few. But for many the jar, as it appears, is still half empty.\n\n""We will grow old before we grow rich"" if growth isn\'t faster and more equitable, says Dr Rajan.'"

""We have never claimed to be related to Elon Musk\'s Tesla,"" Tesla Power\'s Manoj Pahwa said, per Reuters.\n\nTesla told the judge it discovered the Indian company was using its brand name in 2022 and had unsuccessfully tried to stop it from doing so, forcing it to file the lawsuit.\n\nMr Musk also recently cancelled his planned visit to India on April 21 to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, he made a surprise visit to China, seen by many as a snub to India.\n\nIt comes after Tesla experienced a recent sales slump, with the company reporting a 55 per cent drop in profit in its first quarter. On Tuesday, Tesla stock dropped five per cent, following a previous decline of below $150 per share.\n\nEarlier this month the manufacturer was forced to discount five of their models by $5,000 earlier this month. In the same week, Tesla announced it would be eliminating 10 per cent of its workforce, which totalled about 14,000 jobs across the globe.\n\nFollowing the announcement about its electric vehicle charging station construction team, New York City rideshare and EV charging company Revel has expressed interest in the real estate.\n\nFrank Reig, the CEO and co-founder of Revel, told InsideEVs, that as the company expands its fast-charger network it is looking to potentially build at several of the sites that Tesla has stepped away from.\n\n""Tesla has left some really good sites on the table in New York,"" Mr Reig told the outlet.\n\n""They\'re power-ready, have good landlords and are in the right locations to get a lot of use, particularly from rideshare drivers.

Citi\'s views suggest its lure is unlikely to dim.\n\n""Global investors have preferred the rupee within most Asian long-short relative value baskets because of its carry and volatility dynamics,"" Swami said.

It will rally through its peak in March and hit 82 per dollar by the end of 2024, according to Malayan Banking Bhd.\n\nWhile the rupee is poised to strengthen, its gains may still be capped because of the Reserve Bank of India\'s tight hold on the currency, guided by its goal to keep it stable and shield India\'s export competitiveness.\n\n""Under normal circumstances, we would view an election win for Modi as being positive for the rupee given that the country has prospered economically under his administration,"" said Shaun Lim, a currency strategist at Malayan Banking. ""However, RBI has had a preference to lean against the wind and keep the rupee stable and that any significant gains could be tempered by their policy leanings.""\n\nThe rupee is seen gaining to 82.80 per dollar by year-end from 83.2513 on Wednesday, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nNevertheless, traders will look forward to the count of votes on June 4 as India\'s seven-phase election that started in April is nearing an end, and a landslide majority for Modi\'s party may support the rupee. Modi has pledged to boost infrastructure and expand welfare programs should he win a third term in office as he seeks to transform the nation into a developed economy by the mid-century.\n\nThe rupee is among Asia\'s best performers this year, bolstered by about $6 billion in foreign inflows into local-currency bonds ahead of the inclusion of sovereign bonds into JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s emerging-market index in June.\n\n""If we get a strong mandate for the government, that can lead to a return of foreign investor flows,"" said Anindya Banerjee, head of research, currency and commodity derivatives at Kotak Securities in Mumbai.

The modest expectations are in line with the Reserve Bank of India\'s overarching aim to keep the rupee stable, as well as the government\'s goal to ensure that the currency\'s strength does not hurt its exports.\n\n""RBI\'s objective is to prevent outsized moves in the rupee in either direction,"" said Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, adding that this would limit the rupee\'s upside.\n\nThe RBI\'s viselike grip on the rupee has made the currency one of Asia\'s least volatile - a quality that helped burnish the appeal of Indian assets in a year when a resurgent dollar wreaked havoc in foreign-exchange markets. The central bank is likely to mop up inflows arising from India\'s inclusion in key bond indexes instead of letting the rupee appreciate substantially, according to Barclays Plc analysts.\n\nThe rupee ended little changed at 83.4987 on Friday after sliding to an all-time low of 83.5750 last month.\n\nSome traders are positioning for the currency to rebound, given that India\'s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s bond index may draw as much as $30 billion of inflows.

554,554,"b'(Reuters) - The day before Elon Musk fired virtually all of Tesla\'s electric-vehicle charging division last month, they had high hopes as charging chief Rebecca Tinucci went to meet with Musk about the network\'s future, four former charging-network staffers told Reuters.\n\nAfter Tinucci had cut between 15% and 20% of staffers two weeks earlier, part of much wider layoffs, they believed Musk would affirm plans for a massive charging-network expansion.\n\nThe meeting could not have gone worse. Musk, the employees said, was not pleased with Tinucci\'s presentation and wanted more layoffs. When she balked, saying deeper cuts would undermine charging-business fundamentals, he responded by firing her and her entire 500-member team.\n\nThe departures have upended a network widely viewed as a signature Tesla achievement and a key driver of its EV sales. Tesla Superchargers account for more than 60% of U.S. high-speed charging ports, federal statistics show, and the company has been the biggest winner so far of $5 billion in federal funding for new chargers.\n\nThis account, the most detailed to date on the Supercharger firings and the fallout, is based on interviews with eight former charging-division employees, one contractor and a Tesla email sent to outside vendors. Only Musk and Tinucci were in the meeting described to Reuters; the four sources with knowledge of the meeting are relaying what they heard about it from Supercharger department managers.\n\nTesla, Musk and Tinucci did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nDespite the mass firings, Musk has since posted on social media promising to continue expanding the network. But three former charging-team employees told Reuters they have been fielding calls from vendors, contractors and electric utilities, some of which had spent millions of dollars on equipment and infrastructure to help build out Tesla\'s network.\n\nA letter sent earlier this month by a Tesla global-supply manager to Supercharger contractors and suppliers instructed them to ""please hold on breaking ground on any newly awarded construction projects"" and halt materials purchases, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters. ""I understand that this period of change may be challenging, and that patience is not easy when expecting to be paid!""\n\nTesla\'s energy team, which sells solar and battery-storage products for homes and businesses, was tasked with taking over Superchargers and calling some partners to close out ongoing charger-construction projects, said three of the former Tesla employees.\n\nOne construction contractor said Tesla staffers contacting his company since the layoffs ""don\'t know a thing."" The contractor said he had expected Supercharger projects to provide about 20% of his 2024 revenue but now plans to diversify to avoid relying on Tesla.\n\nTinucci was one of few high-ranking female Tesla executives. She recently started reporting directly to Musk, following the departure of battery-and-energy chief Drew Baglino, according to four former Supercharger-team staffers. They said Baglino had historically overseen the charging department without much involvement from Musk.\n\nThe charging-team layoffs mark the latest drama in a tumultuous year for Tesla as Musk has shut down or delayed several core efforts meant to drive the rapid EV sales growth that investors have expected. Instead, Musk now says Tesla will shift its main focus to self-driving cars, a fiercely competitive and riskier business that could take years to develop.\n\nThe company posted its first decline in auto sales since 2020 in the first quarter amid fierce competition from Chinese electric-vehicle makers and sagging worldwide EV demand. Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-awaited affordable car known as the Model 2. That has thrown into doubt Tesla\'s plans for new factories in Mexico and India, where Musk had been expected to travel last month to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before canceling at the last minute. And a host of executives have departed amid deep companywide layoffs.\n\nSCALED-BACK CHARGING EXPANSION\n\nThe energy team that was assigned to take over charging-network management has some similar design and construction roles, two of the former Tesla employees said. But charging projects are fundamentally different because they are located in public places and require extensive negotiations with utilities, local governments and landowners, they said.\n\nThe energy team was already struggling to keep pace with its current workload, said two of the former charging-network staffers. Yet when the layoffs came down on April 30, Musk posted that the company ""still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace."" On Friday, Musk posted that ""Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.""\n\nTwo former Supercharger staffers called the $500 million expansion budget a significant reduction from what the team had planned for 2024 - but nonetheless a challenge requiring hundreds of employees. In an analysis provided to Reuters, San Francisco research firm EVAdoption estimated a $500 million investment this year would translate to Tesla building 77% fewer charging ports per month in the United States compared with the automaker\'s pace through April.\n\n\'HOLDING THE BAG\'\n\nTesla unveiled its first Supercharger stations throughout California in 2012, with Musk calling the network a ""game changer"" for EVs that would enable long-distance travel and convenience ""equivalent to gasoline cars.""\n\nThe EV-charging business requires substantial upfront investment, and analysts have often viewed it as unprofitable. But Tesla\'s network had been profitable before the layoffs, according to four former Tesla employees familiar with the division\'s financial performance.\n\nThat owed to Tesla\'s cost-control and extensive analysis to choose locations that could draw business throughout the day rather than only during peak-demand times, when electricity costs spike. One former Supercharger staffer said Tesla\'s costs per-charging-port were typically at least 50% lower than those of competitors.\n\nAs recently as last month, Tesla said in a securities filing that it needed to expand charging to ""ensure adequate availability"" for customers, particularly after automakers including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Hyundai announced they would start making their cars compatible with Tesla\'s charging plugs, giving their vehicles Supercharger access.\n\nAnother former employee said that rollout is ""completely jeopardized"" because there will not be enough new charging sites coming online, and the company was only starting to implement upgrades to allow more compatibility with other manufacturers\' vehicles.\n\nThree of the former employees called the firings a major setback to U.S. charging expansion because of the relationships Tesla employees had built with suppliers and electric utilities. Tesla had grown into one of the larger customers for many major utilities around the country, and many had hired new staff and planned new infrastructure based on Tesla\'s charging-network expansion plans, the former employees said.\n\nOther companies may be able to fill the gap, the former employees said, but the goodwill built over time with utilities and other contractors from Tesla\'s large-scale charging investments will be difficult to replicate.\n\n""It\'s just unfortunate that now they\'re stuck holding the bag on all these different projects,"" one of the former employees said. ""It\'s really sad to see all these relationships burned and people be really angry - rightfully so.""\n\n(Reporting by Chris Kirkham in Los Angeles, and Hyunjoo Jin and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Edited by Brian Thevenot and Matthew Lewis)'"

557,557,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk was in dire need of a quick win for Tesla Inc. If that meant flying to China a week after standing up Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then so be it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe billionaire\'s surprise trip to Beijing on Sunday for meetings with officials including Premier Li Qiang paid immediate dividends. Tesla secured tentative approval to deploy its more advanced driver-assistance features in China, potentially boosting revenue in its second-most important market.\n\nTesla\'s China business could use the lift -- the company has repeatedly cut prices over the last 18 months to levels that may have completely wiped out earnings from the country. The company\'s shares soared as much as 14% before the start of regular trading Monday, extending a post-earnings rally.\n\nThe timing suits China, too. The government has been trying to persuade foreign investors that its economy is still open for business, despite government crackdowns and a deflationary crisis. One of the countries it\'s been losing out to amid all the upheaval happens to be India, whose leaders Musk left hanging just over a week ago, citing pressing issues for Tesla.\n\nMusk\'s trip is ""part of the bigger picture of the government in Beijing and local governments wanting to be more open to foreign investment,"" said You Chuanman, head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen\'s IIA Centre for Regulation and Global Governance.\n\nFor the government, there\'s the added bonus of being seen as welcoming to a prominent US business just after President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that forces TikTok\'s parent company to sell its stake or be banned from app stores. ""That could be considered a signal from Beijing of how different it is for the Chinese government side to accept or welcome foreign investors, while in the US it is the opposite,"" You said.\n\nRed Carpet\n\nMusk\'s visit was in some ways a return to a safe haven.\n\nTesla holds a unique position among China\'s most-favored foreign companies. It was the first international carmaker to operate without having to form a joint venture with a local manufacturer -- an exception not granted to the likes of Volkswagen AG or General Motors Co. The approval for this arrangement was facilitated by Li, the former party chief of Shanghai who is now China\'s No. 2 official.\n\nRead More: Musk Loves China, and China Loves Him Back -- for Now\n\nThat red-carpet treatment contrasts with Tesla\'s long-standing impasse with India, whose trade and tax policies have been unwelcoming to foreign carmakers. Musk said in 2022 that Tesla wouldn\'t set up manufacturing plants in countries where the company isn\'t allowed to first sell and service vehicles.\n\nTesla\'s ties to India showed signs of strengthening in recent months, with expectations building that Tesla may commit about $2 billion to an EV plant, and the government lowering import taxes on vehicles from foreign carmakers that pledge to invest in local manufacturing.\n\nBut any such announcement has been put off. Musk scrapped his visit to India a day before he was supposed to land, just as India\'s elections were getting underway. The nation\'s economic rise is core to Modi\'s campaign for a third term.\n\nThe trip to Beijing drew the ire of some prominent users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk took over in 2022. Television anchor Sumanth Raman questioned why urgent work at Tesla kept Musk from visiting India, but didn\'t stop him from traveling to China.\n\nMusk\'s postponed India trip may reflect a change in strategy. The CEO announced last week that Tesla was accelerating new models that the company will produce on the same manufacturing lines as its current lineup. Analysts have speculated this could mean the carmaker will further delay construction of a new factory in Mexico, not to mention a plant in India.\n\n\'Nice-to-Have\'\n\nForeign automakers have had trouble finding long-term success in the world\'s most populous nation. Ford Motor Co. said in 2022 that it was exploring alternatives for its manufacturing facilities in India, a year after announcing it would cease making cars in the country. Toyota Motor Corp. said in 2020 that it wouldn\'t expand further due to high tariffs, though it\'s since announced plans to make some EV components in the country.\n\nIndian officials are hopeful that Musk will invest in the near future due to recent changes to EV policies, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nUltimately, Musk\'s decision to visit China underscores the sense of urgency to get Tesla back on track. EVs make up only a fraction of India\'s car market. In China, approval for the system Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving may help the company claw back some of the market share it\'s lost to domestic manufacturers led by BYD Co.\n\n""China is the linchpin to anything Tesla wants to do. China is a must-have market in terms of vehicle sales, and India is a nice-to-have,"" said Tu Le, the managing director of consultancy Sino Auto Insights.

That\'s despite India benefiting, along with the likes of Vietnam and Mexico, from international firms wanting to diversify their operations from China.\n\nManufacturing\'s share in the economy has actually declined over the years to 13% in 2022, well below Modi\'s goal of 25%.\n\nHere are some of the key policy priorities foreign businesses and economists say are needed in Modi\'s likely third term:\n\nPolicy Action\n\nKamal Bali, president and chief executive officer of Volvo AB\'s India operation, says there are huge variations across India\'s 28 states and not enough policy coordination among them.\n\nThere\'s only about 7-10 states that are doing well, with about 20 that ""will have to pick up the pace and have to grow and get policies that are conducive,"" he said. ""That\'s a big ask and a big challenge.""\n\nModi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party draws its support mainly from the northern Hindi-speaking belt of the country. In the southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, regional and opposition parties tend to dominate.\n\nWith its relatively better educated and wealthier population than the north, the southern region is also where Apple Inc. and Google are setting up mobile phone factories, and where Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has its global capability center set up.\n\nFriction between the opposition-controlled states and the BJP-led national government often plays out around issues like farming policies and how central government tax revenue should be shared among the states.\n\n""India doesn\'t have regional equity and besides that it needs better bonhomie between the states and center so that each of the policies are implemented at both the levels,"" Bali said.\n\nLabor Policies\n\nWhile the government\'s policy intentions are good, there\'s still not enough follow-through on the ground, Bali said.\n\nOne area where this shows up is in the labor policy. To simplify labor rules, the Modi government merged 29 labor and industrial laws into four labor codes, which were passed by the parliament in 2019 and 2020.\n\nAmong other things, the laws allow companies with up to 300 workers to lay off workers without the state government\'s approval, and make it tough for the labor unions to be recognized, moves which some states see as controversial and anti-worker. Several states are yet to frame rules for some of these codes, delaying implementation.\n\n""Policy pronouncement and policy implementation gap needs to be bridged,"" Bali said.\n\nAnother key challenge is the lack of appropriate skills in the workforce. One of India\'s major advantages is its young and growing population of 1.4 billion people, but economists like Raghuram Rajan, India\'s former central bank governor, often highlight the poor level of schooling as a drawback. One basic measure is literacy rates, with India at about 76%, lagging far behind Vietnam\'s 96% and a world average of 87%.\n\nBali echoed those concerns, saying ""there\'s a huge talent-skills mismatch"" in the country. ""When businesses want to hire they do not get the right skill-set, so they train and re-train and re-train,"" he added.\n\nLand Reform\n\nA law that made it easier for companies to acquire land for projects was withdrawn in 2015 following widespread protests from farmers. The law had exempted certain sectors, such as defense and industrial corridors, from getting mandatory consent of 70% of farmers for acquiring agricultural land.\n\nPranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, says there\'s been notable progress in the past decade to boost new sectors, such as high tech manufacturing, professional services and exports. The next phase of reforms will need to focus on fixing stickier problems, like land and labor policies, which continue to hold back investment, she said.\n\n""We have become good at sectoral reforms"" like production-linked incentive schemes for electronics and mobile phone manufacturing, she said. The next set of reforms needed are ""more sector agnostic, in the sense that every sector benefits,"" she added.\n\nTrade Measures\n\nModi\'s government is trying to boost its share of global trade and key to that would be reviewing its relatively high tariff structure on imports. Daikin\'s Jawa said to lift manufacturing, the government needs to lower duties on raw material imports while curbing the overseas purchases of finished goods.\n\nThe government is negotiating trade pacts with several major partners such as the European Union and the UK, and has shown it\'s willing to address thorny issues like labor in the trade deals in a bid to shed its protectionist image and attract investment. Even so, India isn\'t part of any major Asia-wide trade pact, like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nDaikin\'s Jawa also says he wants the Modi government to continue its production-linked incentive schemes and that free-trade agreements should be directed toward goods targeted by those incentives. He also called for a reduction in consumption taxes on air conditioning units.\n\nBJP\'s Promises\n\nIn its election manifesto, the ruling party pledged to make India a trusted global manufacturing hub by simplifying regulatory processes, and investing in infrastructure and research and development. Modi\'s ambition is to make India a major player in sectors such as chip manufacturing, aviation and defense equipment.\n\nBhandari says the next set of reforms needed in the economy would be more contentious to implement and require more political capital.\n\n""The next decade belongs more to India than the previous decade did, but for that the new government must move fast,"" she added.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'"

562,562,"b'(Bloomberg) -- Before India\'s marathon election kicked off in April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was promising to come back to power with an even bigger majority than he won five years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWith less than two weeks to go before election results are announced, the picture is looking less certain for the popular leader.\n\nParty insiders, opposition members and analysts who have traveled across the country to speak to voters say there\'s little evidence of a ""Modi wave"" that allowed his Bharatiya Janata Party to sweep the polls in 2019. Then, the BJP won 303 of the 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Along with its allies, the BJP-led coalition had about 351 seats.\n\nModi targeted more than 400 seats for his coalition this time around, a goal emblazoned on campaign posters and one the prime minister frequently plugged in his campaign speeches. But a notable shift in Modi\'s tone after the first phase of voting -- where he began using divisive, anti-Muslim language and ramped up attacks against the main opposition group\'s welfare policies -- fueled speculation the BJP may have been spooked by early voting trends and needed to fire up its support base.\n\nElection rules don\'t allow for any result polls to be published during the six weeks of voting, so it\'s difficult to know with any certainty whether the BJP\'s support has indeed declined. India\'s first-past-the-post electoral system means even small margins can decide the winner. Exit polls won\'t be published until June 1 with results expected on June 4.\n\nMuddying the waters even further is the fact that both the ruling party and opposition are claiming publicly they have the upper hand. Modi himself told The Economic Times this week that the BJP has already won a majority of the seats in the parliament based on voting in the first five phases of elections so far.\n\nHowever, behind closed doors a picture is emerging of an opposition alliance that\'s slightly more optimistic about their likely gains, and a ruling party that appears to be bracing for some losses. The Indian National Congress, the main opposition group, expects to win between 90-110 seats in total, up from 52 in 2019, according to a senior party leader, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The estimates were based on internal polling, the person said.\n\nThree BJP officials from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana states privately admitted that the party is unlikely to match its 2019 figures, although they still expect to win a majority of the seats in parliament. The officials asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about internal matters.\n\nNalin Kohli, a spokesman for the BJP, said there\'s no reason why the ruling party and its allies won\'t significantly increase their results from five years ago given the performance of the Modi government and his leadership. Congress party spokespeople weren\'t immediately available to comment when contacted for further information.\n\nUncertainty about the poll outcome has already seeped into financial markets, with volatility rising in recent weeks. The India VIX Index -- a gauge of likely market swings over the next 30 days -- more than doubled from a low in April.\n\nForeigners pulled $3.5 billion from local shares in May, although there are now signs of global funds ending their bearish view. Indian equities hit a record on Thursday after the central bank\'s generous dividend to the government and Modi\'s comments to The Economic Times of an expected ""historic mandate.""\n\nMajority Mark\n\nPolitical analysts and economists are less optimistic.\n\nRahul Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank, expects the BJP to stay in power, while winning anywhere between 282 to 310 seats nationally. Shumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, was more bearish, saying anecdotal evidence during her recent travels from India\'s east to west coast suggests the BJP could possibly fall below the majority mark of 272 seats. With the help of its allies, though, the party will still be able to form the government, she said in a report on May 16.\n\nReasons for the BJP\'s slide in support are varied, according to party officials and analysts. Modi has been in power for a decade and has delivered on several of the BJP\'s key pledges, a key one being the building of a temple in honor of the Hindu god Ram on a site where an ancient mosque once stood. The inauguration of the temple in Ayodhya in January fulfilled a key promise made to the BJP\'s Hindu nationalist base for decades.\n\n""Anecdotal evidence from our travels on the election trail from India\'s east coast to its west suggests that Modi\'s popularity has waned somewhat since the Ram temple inauguration in January, when a BJP wave seemed to have swept across India,"" Deveshwar said. ""Although multiple factors at play in a country as vast as India make the national mood difficult to read, common themes we picked up on the road include the lack of job creation and rising demand for welfare schemes.""\n\nBeyond those, voters\' concerns have been dominated by the high cost of living and caste identity, observers say. The opposition\'s heavy focus on improving the welfare of the poor, especially those who belong to the lowest social groups, have resonated with voters, they say.\n\nModi\'s 400-seat target may have been counter-productive, too, since it might have led to complacency in the BJP\'s ranks while fueling a belief among lower-caste voters that the BJP will use its parliamentary super-majority to push through changes that reduce affirmative action policies for lower socio-economic groups. Home Minister Amit Shah has consistently denied the party has any such plan, although that hasn\'t stopped the opposition from exploiting voters\' anxiety around this.\n\nThe shift in momentum was in some evidence in the electorally important state of Uttar Pradesh, considered a stronghold for the BJP after it swept the region with 71 out of 80 seats in 2014 and won 62 in the 2019 elections.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav, leader of the Samajwadi Party, the biggest opposition group in Uttar Pradesh, has been drawing significant crowds to political rallies, where he campaigns alongside alliance members, like the Congress party and the Trinamool Congress. The alliance parties have agreed not to contest seats against each other, allowing them to consolidate the opposition vote against the BJP.\n\nWATCH: How India\'s Leader Is Preparing for a 1,000-Year Legacy\n\nYadav and Rahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party, were due to address a rally together earlier this week in a town in Uttar Pradesh, but were forced to leave after throngs of supporters rushed the stage to see the two leaders, pushing through police barricades.\n\nThe two men, relatively young leaders in their 50s, represent change for the voters who are disillusioned with the decade-long rule of 73-year-old Modi. Heading into a third term, the ""brand value of Modi isn\'t there"" and the opposition is putting up a strong fight in Uttar Pradesh, said Sunita Aron, an author of three books on Indian politics, including a biography on Yadav.\n\n""The body language between Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi shows they\'re friendly, they share a camaraderie,"" said Aron, who was an executive editor for the Hindustan Times in Uttar Pradesh for more than two decades. ""If the two leaders are standing on a stage, holding hands, that sends a message to the cadres on the ground that we\'re coordinating, we\'re working together.""\n\nUttar Pradesh was once again seen as a walkover for the BJP when the election began, but Aron said there\'s now at least 25-30 seats in contention for the opposition.\n\n""The BJP has an edge, but the alliance is giving it a good fight,"" she said.\n\nThe clamor for change was evident on Tuesday at a rally in the rural town of Bhadohi, in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Flying in on a helicopter that sent dust clouds high up in the air, Yadav was cheered on by more than 8,000 supporters, predominantly young men, waiting in 40-degree heat to catch a glimpse of the leader, campaigning there on behalf of a candidate from the Trinamool Congress.\n\nYadav told his supporters the alliance will increase government jobs and waive loans for farmers, prompting huge roars from the crowd. In an interview after his speech, he criticized the Modi government for its policies and said the ruling party was losing support because of rising joblessness and inflation. He said the opposition alliance was aligned on its priorities, including improving affirmative action policies for the lowest caste groups.\n\nHe predicted the BJP will lose its majority and the opposition will form the government.\n\n""The BJP route to power was through Uttar Pradesh, now they are losing all seats and that will be their end,"" Yadav said.\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty and Ravil Shirodkar.'"

565,565,"b""(Bloomberg) -- India's biggest ever high-yield rupee corporate bond, held by a number of global private credit funds, is casting a spotlight on pockets of stress within the nation's credit markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSome holders of the 143 billion rupee ($1.7 billion) note issued last year by Goswami Infratech Pvt are planning to ask the company for sweeteners in exchange for potentially accepting a company proposal to delay a payment, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nGoswami Infratech is an investment company within the Shapoorji Pallonji group under billionaire Shapoor Mistry. Its projects include apartments, warehouses, parking spaces and shops. The company has said it may not be able to pay 14 billion rupees that could come due later this month if certain terms aren't met, and effectively asked to push that back to later this year.\n\nIn response, some holders are considering asking the builder for consent fees, changes to existing collateral or a slight increase in the payment that could come due later this month, the people said, asking not to be identified speaking about a private matter.\n\nThe tussle underscores broader risks posed by payment delays as global private credit investors increasingly wade into emerging markets. India has been among hot spots in Asia, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- whose party is currently contesting parliamentary elections -- has fueled interest by pushing for more infrastructure investment.\n\nPrivate credit investors have been among holders of the Goswami Infratech bond including Cerberus Capital Capital Management LP, Varde Partners LP and Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP. Others have included Canyon Capital, Edelweiss, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, according to a report by Praxis Global Alliance in April.\n\nWhen Goswami Infratech offered the debt in June last year, money managers flocked to the deal, which offered a juicy 18.75% yield.\n\nOf course, such high yields come with bigger risks.

That's forced the engineering and construction conglomerate to attempt to offload assets.\n\nThe group sold its stake in a key port on the east coast of India called Gopalpur earlier this year to an Adani group company. But that came only after failure to reach such a deal by the end of last year breached a clause in the Goswami Infratech bond that resulted in the borrower having to raise the yield to 20.75%.\n\nAnother clause, or so-called covenant, in the note stipulates that the Shapoorji Pallonji group must refinance certain debt of its main investment vehicle Sterling Investment Corp.\n\nGoswami Infratech said in a letter to the bond trustee earlier this month that the covenant would likely be breached, forcing it to pay creditors the 14 billion rupees, because Shapoorji Pallonji group hasn't raised new debt for Sterling Investment.\n\nThe firm said it would then have three business days from May 26 to make that payment, but may not be able to do so.\n\nIt is seeking holders' consent to amend the trigger event date to no later than Sept. 30, or as early as when the covenant criteria are met.\n\nThe investors are going back to their internal investment committees to reach a final decision next week, the people said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek"""

569,569,"b'Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s campaign speeches claim his quelling of an insurgency in Kashmir as one of his greatest achievements, but many in the disputed region see India\'s election as a chance to signal their disagreement.\n\nWidely expected to win the biggest poll in history, Modi\'s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not field any candidates in Kashmir for the first time in nearly three decades. Experts say they would have been roundly defeated if they had.\n\nModi\'s government cancelled the limited autonomy Kashmir had under India\'s constitution in 2019, a move accompanied by a huge security clampdown, mass arrests of local political leaders and a months-long telecommunications blackout.\n\nViolence in the Muslim-majority region has since dwindled, and the BJP has consistently claimed that its residents supported the changes.\n\nBut some Kashmiri voters in this year\'s national elections will be eager to express their frustrations with the end of their territory\'s special status.\n\n""I have never voted in the past.

581,581,"b'ANANTNAG, India (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi is criss-crossing India in a marathon election campaign but, for the first time since 1996, his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not contesting in Kashmir, where a 35-year uprising against Indian rule has killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nInstead, the main contenders for the three seats in the Muslim-majority region are powerful local parties, the National Conference and the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP). They will contest against each other but both say they are opposed to the Hindu nationalist BJP and will align with the Congress party-led opposition alliance.\n\nAnalysts and opposition parties say the BJP decided to skip contesting the election because the outcome is likely to contradict Modi\'s narrative of a peaceful, more integrated Kashmir since he removed the region\'s semi-autonomous status in 2019 and brought it under New Delhi\'s control.\n\nThe BJP, along with allies, is contesting in every other part of India and is tipped to win a majority of parliament\'s 543 seats on the back of its Hindu-first image.\n\n""Why are they absent from the election?"" asked Omar Abdullah, a leader of the National Conference and a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state.\n\n""Clearly there is a gap between what the BJP claims to have done and the reality on the ground,"" he said, speaking in his home in Kashmir\'s main city, Srinagar.\n\nModi says his 2019 decision brought normalcy to Kashmir after decades of bloodshed and that he will bring investments and jobs soon. The federal Home (Interior) Minister Amit Shah backs up the government\'s position by claiming that youths now hold laptops in their hands instead of stones that they used to throw at security forces in the past.\n\nAs part of the move, Jammu and Kashmir state was split into two federally ruled areas - the Muslim-dominated Kashmir valley with the Hindu-dominated Jammu plains, and mountainous, Buddhist-dominated Ladakh.\n\nThe government slapped a harsh lockdown on Kashmir at the time and Abdullah and almost all other local leaders were held in custody for months.\n\nRavinder Raina, the chief of the Kashmir unit of the BJP, said the party\'s decision to skip the election was part of a broader strategy, although he declined to give specifics.\n\n""The BJP will not fight, but support a candidate who will work for peace, happiness, brotherhood and democracy,"" in each of the three seats, he said. The BJP has not yet announced which of the many small parties in the fray it will support.\n\nALIENATION, DISCONTENT\n\nInterviews with over a dozen residents, political leaders, security officials and analysts in Kashmir and New Delhi indicate that discontent and alienation continue to simmer in the heavily militarised Himalayan region.\n\nBesides the three-decade insurgency, Kashmir is divided into India-controlled and Pakistan-controlled sectors and claimed in full by both nations. The nuclear-armed enemies have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Kashmir.\n\nIndia claims that Islamic Pakistan has supported the insurgency in Kashmir, while Islamabad says it only provides moral support to the people there.\n\nAbdul Hameed, a 50-year-old garment store owner in Pulwama town near Srinagar, said the federal government had kept the lid on Kashmir since 2019, masking the true situation.\n\n""But it is like a spring. Right now they have crushed it. But who knows when will it burst open again,"" he said.\n\nAlthough there are fewer restrictions on people\'s movements compared to five years ago, there are still tens of thousands of troops in the valley to enforce the peace.\n\nFor decades, residents and human rights groups have accused Indian security forces of atrocities against the mainly Muslim population. The government says cases of abuse are isolated acts and it prosecutes any soldier found guilty of human rights violations.\n\nIndian military data shows there are over 100 active militants in the region, who allegedly target security forces and workers from other parts of India. Militants killed an air force soldier in an attack on a military convoy on Saturday, officials said.\n\n""The absence of an elected system over here is an indication of the fact that things are not as they are portrayed,"" said Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a retired law professor in Srinagar. ""They (the BJP) should have treated (this election) as a referendum in their favour. But they seem to be scared.""\n\nIn the May 2019 general election, the BJP contested all three seats in Kashmir, losing them to Abdullah\'s National Conference. This year, BJP is contesting the two seats in Jammu and one in Ladakh, all of which it had won in 2019.\n\nMehbooba Mufti, the chief of the PDP, is contesting from the Anantnag-Rajouri constituency, which many believed might have been the BJP\'s best bet to enter Kashmir in this election.\n\nGERRYMANDERING\n\nIn 2022, a federal government-appointed commission changed the borders of constituencies in Kashmir and Jammu.\n\nTo Kashmir\'s Anantnag, which had around 1.6 million largely Muslim votes in 2019, it added around 1 million mostly Hindu voters from Jammu\'s Poonch and Rajouri districts.\n\nMufti told Reuters that by clubbing them, the Modi administration was ""changing the balance of the voters"". The BJP, she said, wants to ""disempower and they want to divest, dispossess Muslims, especially the Kashmiris.""\n\nNational Conference\'s Abdullah also claimed that the redrawing of the district was done to give BJP an ""advantage"".\n\nBut they still didn\'t field a candidate, which ""tells you just how bad things must be for the BJP"", Abdullah said.\n\nHowever, BJP\'s Raina said that the redrawing has made the constituencies more representative of the region.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik and Fayaz Bukhari in Anantnag and Srinagar; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)'"

Its slogan before this year\'s election began was ""Ab ki baar, 400 paar"" or ""This time, above 400"".\n\nMore than half a dozen BJP leaders and political analysts that Reuters spoke to said a lack of momentum in the two initial phases of the seven-phase election have dampened hopes of a huge majority for the party, although they said it was still likely to retain power in the world\'s most populous nation.\n\nWhat could be affected is the BJP\'s aim to get a two-thirds majority in the chamber, or 362 seats, which would let the party usher in far-reaching constitutional changes.\n\n""The fall in polling turnout is mainly due to apathy among party workers and voters,"" said Sanjay Sharma, one of the members of the BJP\'s campaign committee in the northern state of Haryana.\n\nSome candidates were being affected by an anti-incumbency wave, he said, adding the party was facing a ""tough fight"" in the state where it won all ten parliamentary seats in 2019.\n\nModi himself has shifted in his campaign speeches from a focus on the administration\'s successes in his 10-year tenure to targeting minority Muslims and the opposition Congress party.\n\n""After the first phase, we saw a definite change of strategy by the PM...delivering Islamophobic kind of speeches,"" said Arati Jerath, a Delhi-based political commentator.\n\n""Obviously, he has now decided to polarise the campaign.""\n\nA total of 190 seats went to the polls on April 19 and 27 with approximate voter turnout at about 66%, the Election Commission has said.

He said he would not waste time and money to travel to his hometown Prayagraj to vote as Modi\'s party was set to win the election.\n\n""Minority votes do not stand anywhere in the majoritarian government... there is no point in wasting time,"" he said.\n\nAnirudh Singh, one of the district campaign managers of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, said the party would have reaped rich electoral dividends if the election was held during February-March, when fervour over the construction of the Ram Temple was at its peak.\n\n""The party has failed to encash public support for Modi after the inauguration of the temple,"" said Singh, noting that the religious feel-good mood had by and large been replaced by issues like jobs and inflation.\n\n""So far there\'s neither a communal wave, nor a Ram wave, nor a Modi wave in the election,"" said Jerath, the political commentator, noting Modi would have to re-invigorate his party workers and supporters if he hoped for a sweep.\n\nAfter being battered by Modi in the two last general elections, opposition parties are hopeful of a better performance.\n\nThe shift in the language and style of Modi\'s campaign reflected a sense of nervousness, said Jairam Ramesh, a Congress party general secretary.\n\n""The initial voting trends show there is no Modi wave.

The party\'s star campaigner Rahul Gandhi also promised debt waiver for farmers.\n\nBut Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has avoided promising any new major welfare measures.\n\n""Despite higher revenue from the RBI dividend, we doubt the government would opt for more populist expenditure in its budget, if the government is BJP-led,"" said Shreya Sodhani, an economist at Barclays.\n\n""The current government has not shown a disposition towards populist spending even in an election year.""\n\nThe BJP-led government resisted the temptation of spending trillions of rupees on schemes for the poor in its last budget before the election while raising spending on infrastructure to 11.11 trillion rupees, more than three time the sum spent in 2019.\n\nQUICKER FISCAL CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe new government will likely present the final budget in July, leaving the administration with only eight months to spend funds allocated to them.\n\nGovernment spending has been slow so far in the year, with the start of elections from April. Tax collections, meanwhile, have been strong due to buoyancy in the economy.\n\nIndia collected a record 2.10 trillion rupees in goods and services taxes in April, the first month of the financial year, ensuring the government is on track to meet its planned fiscal goal of 5.1% of GDP this year.\n\nThis could mean the government will lean towards using the bumper dividend for fiscal consolidation.\n\nThere is scope for a slight reduction in the targeted fiscal deficit for the current year, said Ashima Goyal, a professor and an external member of the country\'s monetary policy committee, who expects the government to comfortably achieve the targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5% by 2025/26.\n\nIndia\'s fiscal deficit ballooned to 9.2% during the pandemic but the government has steadily brought this down.\n\nBut bringing down the deficit by 130 basis points from 5.8% in 2023/24 was seen as challenging and dependent on one-off revenue from either privatisation or auction of telecom spectrum.\n\n($1 = 83.1900 Indian rupees)\n\n(Reporting by Aftab Ahmed and Swati Bhat; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)'"

600,600,"b'GHORAMARA, India (Reuters) - As voters across India cast their ballots in the general election on issues ranging from the cost of living to jobs and religion, the residents of a tiny, ecologically sensitive island have only one concern - survival.\n\nThe residents of Ghoramara in the Sundarbans delta on the Bay of Bengal are fighting to save their homes from disappearing into the sea in the face of rising sea levels and increasingly fierce storms, putting climate change front and centre for politicians trying to win their vote.\n\nHome to more than 4.5 million people, the Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world and regarded as a climate-change hotspot as the planet gets warmer. The region is shared by India and Bangladesh.\n\n""For us, the protection of the island is the main issue in this election,"" said Bimal Patra, 60, one of just over 3,700 registered voters in Ghoramara, an island in the delta.\n\nIndia is holding a massive general election over seven weeks. The people of Ghoramara go to the polls on Saturday, the final day of voting, as part of the Mathurapur constituency.\n\nThe plight of the island\'s inhabitants highlights the broader concerns about the impact of climate change on the environment and the urgency for solutions.\n\nSituated 150 kilometres (94 miles) south of Kolkata, media has dubbed Ghoramara the \'sinking island\'. It has lost nearly half of its area to soil erosion in the last two decades and could completely disappear within a few decades if a solution is not found. In the decade to 2020, the population has fallen to around 4,000 from 7,000.\n\n""We want the banks reinforced with stone boulders or rehabilitation in other places. Probably rehabilitation is the only answer,"" said Patra, who once had acres of land that have now been lost to the sea.\n\nPatra said his house was once a kilometre from the river\'s edge but now stands just 150 metres away.\n\nWAY OF LIFE\n\nResearchers say as climate change has forced a rise in sea surface temperatures, seasonal, cyclonic storms barrelling in from the Bay of Bengal have become more fierce and frequent, particularly in the last decade.\n\nThe island\'s inhabitants were once predominantly dependent on agriculture, with most families farming rice and betel leaves. But cyclones in 2020 and 2021 flooded the fields with water high in saline, leaving the soil barren.\n\nAs people have migrated away from the island, especially youths, transport links with the mainland have fallen to just five ferries a day.\n\nPatra lives alone. His wife works as a nursemaid in Kolkata, his two daughters, who are married, and his teacher son live on the mainland.\n\n""It\'s encouraging to see people in this rural area prioritising this issue (environment). It\'s unfortunate that no one is listening to them,"" said Sugata Hazra, the former head of the school of oceanographic studies at Jadavpur University in Kolkata.\n\n""Cities across India are already facing drinking water scarcity. They (urban dwellers) should be more conscious of (the) environment and make it a primary issue alongside the economy and jobs.""\n\nSome Ghoramara residents have planted mangrove saplings to try to reduce waterfront erosion, while the local administration displays notices across the island banning single-use plastic and polystyrene. A solid waste management system has been put in place.\n\nCandidates from both Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress party (TMC), which won the 2019 polls for Mathurapur, visited the island recently.\n\n""I am aware of their main issue, which is erosion,"" said BJP candidate Ashok Purkait, promising to find a permanent fix.\n\nThe TMC-run state government recently announced a project, supported by the World Bank, to strengthen the embankments of the islands in Sundarbans.\n\n""Our priority is rehabilitation. People cannot survive an entire lifetime fighting natural disasters,"" said Bankim Hazra, the state\'s minister for the Sundarbans.\n\nMany villagers are sceptical the promises will turn into action, but Patra hopes for the best.\n\n""Elections may not be a celebration for us, but it still brings hope and everyone here actively participates in the voting process,"" he said.\n\n(For a picture essay, please click here )\n\n(Writing by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Neil Fullick)'"

mines.\n\nShukla has led a decade-long grassroots campaign against some of India\'s conglomerates -- including one operated by Adani Group, helmed by Asia\'s second-richest man -- seeking to tap one of the country\'s richest subterranean stores of fossil fuels.\n\nThe movement had a major triumph in 2021 when, bowing to its demands, the government established an elephant reserve in a 445,000-acre (around 180,000-hectare) swath of the threatened Hasdeo Aranya forest, an area bigger than the size of London.\n\n""It was a great achievement for our struggle,"" Shukla told AFP this month from his base in the woodlands of central Chhattisgarh state.\n\n""Our final fight is that no more mines should be opened and not even a single tree should be cut down here now.""\n\nShukla, 45, was announced on Monday as one of the recipients of this year\'s Goldman Prize, awarded to campaigners for ""sustained and significant"" efforts to protect the environment.\n\nThrough a combination of protest marches, pressure on lawmakers and court cases, Shukla rallied support from thousands living in the forest\'s isolated tribal communities to battle the mining giants.\n\nSeventeen proposed mining sites were closed off from development as a result of the elephant reserve\'s establishment but large stretches of the forest remain earmarked for coal projects.\n\nAnother six proposed mining sites were left out of the reserve, Shukla said, five of which remain dormant while another -- belonging to the Rajasthan state government but run by Adani Group -- is already operational and planning an expansion.\n\nShukla and the Hasdeo forest\'s inhabitants have maintained a sit-in protest for the past two years at the village of Hariharpur, set to be swallowed up if the expansion proceeds.\n\nThe

of poverty.\n\nModi, currently seeking a third term in India\'s six-week-long national election, has championed pro-business policies which activists say have weakened mining and environmental regulations.\n\nThe Hasdeo woodlands are estimated to sit atop an estimated five billion tons of underground coal eagerly sought by conglomerates such as that owned by tycoon Gautam Adani, who has branched into ambitious green energy projects but built his fortune on meeting India\'s voracious appetite for the dirty fuel.\n\nModi\'s opponents have accused the billionaire of unduly benefitting from his close association with the prime minister -- charges he has denied.\n\nAdani Group said in a statement to AFP that its charitable arm was ""committed to improving quality of life of the

mines.\n\nHe and his allies said they had resisted bribes, violent threats and warnings of legal action in the course of their fight.\n\n""It took a long time, it was tough, but people gradually organised and joined the effort,"" 47-year-old Shakuntala Ekka, one of the first few to join his cause, told AFP.\n\nMost of those living in the Hasdeo forest survive on subsistence farming and foraging in the surrounding woodlands, a way of life undisturbed for generations until the arrival of mining companies.\n\nThe Chhattisgarh state government approved the expansion of the Adani-run mine in 2022 but tree-felling work was halted after a blockade by the forest\'s inhabitants.\n\nSince then Shukla and a rotating band of villagers have maintained their sit-in protest at the heart of the proposed expansion site in an effort to stop clearance work from resuming.\n\nAmong them is father-of-six Shiv Prasad Khusro, 35, who had surrendered his family\'s home and farmland in exchange for compensation when mining operations began more than a decade ago.\n\nHe told AFP that he was there as ""a cautionary tale"" to others living in the forest, saying that the money he took for leaving had soon run out and many of his neighbours were now struggling to make ends meet as day labourers.\n\n""I am here to warn those who haven\'t lost their lands, to urge them to fight, because

620,620,"b'(Reuters) - The day before Elon Musk fired virtually all of Tesla\'s electric-vehicle charging division last month, they had high hopes as charging chief Rebecca Tinucci went to meet with Musk about the network\'s future, four former charging-network staffers told Reuters.\n\nAfter Tinucci had cut between 15% and 20% of staffers two weeks earlier, part of much wider layoffs, they believed Musk would affirm plans for a massive charging-network expansion.\n\nThe meeting could not have gone worse. Musk, the employees said, was not pleased with Tinucci\'s presentation and wanted more layoffs. When she balked, saying deeper cuts would undermine charging-business fundamentals, he responded by firing her and her entire 500-member team.\n\nThe departures have upended a network widely viewed as a signature Tesla achievement and a key driver of its EV sales. Tesla Superchargers account for more than 60% of U.S. high-speed charging ports, federal statistics show, and the company has been the biggest winner so far of $5 billion in federal funding for new chargers.\n\nThis account, the most detailed to date on the Supercharger firings and the fallout, is based on interviews with eight former charging-division employees, one contractor and a Tesla email sent to outside vendors. Only Musk and Tinucci were in the meeting described to Reuters; the four sources with knowledge of the meeting are relaying what they heard about it from Supercharger department managers.\n\nTesla, Musk and Tinucci did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nDespite the mass firings, Musk has since posted on social media promising to continue expanding the network. But three former charging-team employees told Reuters they have been fielding calls from vendors, contractors and electric utilities, some of which had spent millions of dollars on equipment and infrastructure to help build out Tesla\'s network.\n\nA letter sent earlier this month by a Tesla global-supply manager to Supercharger contractors and suppliers instructed them to ""please hold on breaking ground on any newly awarded construction projects"" and halt materials purchases, according to a copy reviewed by Reuters. ""I understand that this period of change may be challenging, and that patience is not easy when expecting to be paid!""\n\nTesla\'s energy team, which sells solar and battery-storage products for homes and businesses, was tasked with taking over Superchargers and calling some partners to close out ongoing charger-construction projects, said three of the former Tesla employees.\n\nOne construction contractor said Tesla staffers contacting his company since the layoffs ""don\'t know a thing."" The contractor said he had expected Supercharger projects to provide about 20% of his 2024 revenue but now plans to diversify to avoid relying on Tesla.\n\nTinucci was one of few high-ranking female Tesla executives. She recently started reporting directly to Musk, following the departure of battery-and-energy chief Drew Baglino, according to four former Supercharger-team staffers. They said Baglino had historically overseen the charging department without much involvement from Musk.\n\nThe charging-team layoffs mark the latest drama in a tumultuous year for Tesla as Musk has shut down or delayed several core efforts meant to drive the rapid EV sales growth that investors have expected. Instead, Musk now says Tesla will shift its main focus to self-driving cars, a fiercely competitive and riskier business that could take years to develop.\n\nThe company posted its first decline in auto sales since 2020 in the first quarter amid fierce competition from Chinese electric-vehicle makers and sagging worldwide EV demand. Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-awaited affordable car known as the Model 2. That has thrown into doubt Tesla\'s plans for new factories in Mexico and India, where Musk had been expected to travel last month to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before canceling at the last minute. And a host of executives have departed amid deep companywide layoffs.\n\nSCALED-BACK CHARGING EXPANSION\n\nThe energy team that was assigned to take over charging-network management has some similar design and construction roles, two of the former Tesla employees said. But charging projects are fundamentally different because they are located in public places and require extensive negotiations with utilities, local governments and landowners, they said.\n\nThe energy team was already struggling to keep pace with its current workload, said two of the former charging-network staffers. Yet when the layoffs came down on April 30, Musk posted that the company ""still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace."" On Friday, Musk posted that ""Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year.""\n\nTwo former Supercharger staffers called the $500 million expansion budget a significant reduction from what the team had planned for 2024 - but nonetheless a challenge requiring hundreds of employees. In an analysis provided to Reuters, San Francisco research firm EVAdoption estimated a $500 million investment this year would translate to Tesla building 77% fewer charging ports per month in the United States compared with the automaker\'s pace through April.\n\n\'HOLDING THE BAG\'\n\nTesla unveiled its first Supercharger stations throughout California in 2012, with Musk calling the network a ""game changer"" for EVs that would enable long-distance travel and convenience ""equivalent to gasoline cars.""\n\nThe EV-charging business requires substantial upfront investment, and analysts have often viewed it as unprofitable. But Tesla\'s network had been profitable before the layoffs, according to four former Tesla employees familiar with the division\'s financial performance.\n\nThat owed to Tesla\'s cost-control and extensive analysis to choose locations that could draw business throughout the day rather than only during peak-demand times, when electricity costs spike. One former Supercharger staffer said Tesla\'s costs per-charging-port were typically at least 50% lower than those of competitors.\n\nAs recently as last month, Tesla said in a securities filing that it needed to expand charging to ""ensure adequate availability"" for customers, particularly after automakers including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Hyundai announced they would start making their cars compatible with Tesla\'s charging plugs, giving their vehicles Supercharger access.\n\nAnother former employee said that rollout is ""completely jeopardized"" because there will not be enough new charging sites coming online, and the company was only starting to implement upgrades to allow more compatibility with other manufacturers\' vehicles.\n\nThree of the former employees called the firings a major setback to U.S. charging expansion because of the relationships Tesla employees had built with suppliers and electric utilities. Tesla had grown into one of the larger customers for many major utilities around the country, and many had hired new staff and planned new infrastructure based on Tesla\'s charging-network expansion plans, the former employees said.\n\nOther companies may be able to fill the gap, the former employees said, but the goodwill built over time with utilities and other contractors from Tesla\'s large-scale charging investments will be difficult to replicate.\n\n""It\'s just unfortunate that now they\'re stuck holding the bag on all these different projects,"" one of the former employees said. ""It\'s really sad to see all these relationships burned and people be really angry - rightfully so.""\n\n(Reporting by Chris Kirkham in Los Angeles, and Hyunjoo Jin and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Edited by Brian Thevenot and Matthew Lewis)'"

The modest expectations are in line with the Reserve Bank of India\'s overarching aim to keep the rupee stable, as well as the government\'s goal to ensure that the currency\'s strength does not hurt its exports.\n\n""RBI\'s objective is to prevent outsized moves in the rupee in either direction,"" said Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, adding that this would limit the rupee\'s upside.\n\nThe RBI\'s viselike grip on the rupee has made the currency one of Asia\'s least volatile - a quality that helped burnish the appeal of Indian assets in a year when a resurgent dollar wreaked havoc in foreign-exchange markets. The central bank is likely to mop up inflows arising from India\'s inclusion in key bond indexes instead of letting the rupee appreciate substantially, according to Barclays Plc analysts.\n\nThe rupee ended little changed at 83.4987 on Friday after sliding to an all-time low of 83.5750 last month.\n\nSome traders are positioning for the currency to rebound, given that India\'s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.\'s bond index may draw as much as $30 billion of inflows. In addition, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees more foreign interest in Indian equities if Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins the ongoing election -- another factor that will bolster the rupee.\n\nTraders are also awaiting April consumer-price inflation data due Monday to help gauge the outlook for monetary policy, which will be crucial in determining the rupee\'s path. The RBI has kept the key repo rate on hold for seven straight meetings and officials have signaled their reluctance to cut rates until inflation falls durably to 4%.\n\n""If the dollar doesn\'t strengthen further, 83.40-83.50 could be as high as it gets"" for the currency pair, said Dhiraj Nim, economist and forex strategist at ANZ. ""If the external risks worsen, then USD/INR has an upside in the near term but fundamentally speaking, the drift should be toward a slightly appreciated rupee into the year-end, which is 83 per dollar by December.""\n\nHere are the key Asian economic data this week:\n\n--With assistance from Anup Roy, Kartik Goyal and Ravil Shirodkar.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek'"

Benchmark wheat prices in Chicago jumped this week to their highest in 10 months, before edging lower on Wednesday as hopes for rain in parched Russian sowing areas led investors to lock in profits.\n\nDespite the recent surge in global wheat prices, fuelled by worries that adverse weather conditions could cut output in Russia, industry insiders said duty-free imports were viable.\n\n""There is a compelling case for the removal of the wheat import duty,"" said Pramod Kumar, president of the Roller Flour Millers\' Federation of India. ""That is the best possible way to ensure sufficient supplies in the open market.""\n\nThe government is likely to concede to the demand.\n\n""The considered view is that the wheat import duty should be removed after June, so that the private trade can import wheat,"" said a government source aware of the matter.\n\n""And to protect our farmers\' interest, the duty should be reinstated before wheat planting starts in October,"" added the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the likely course of action by the next government.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party is widely expected to win the election, which ends on June 1, with vote-counting set for June 4.\n\nRajesh Paharia Jain, a New Delhi-based trader, said about 3 million metric tons of imports should be sufficient, with Russia the likeliest supplier.\n\nImports would avert a local price surge after October\'s demand peak for the festival season, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trade house.\n\nImports of 3 million to 5 million metric tons would eliminate the need for New Delhi to sell large quantities from reserves, he added.\n\nAfter five consecutive record harvests, a sharp rise in temperatures shrivelled India\'s wheat crop in 2022 and 2023, prompting the world\'s No. 2 producer to ban exports.\n\nEven this year\'s crop will be 6.25% lower than a government estimate of 112 million metric tons, a leading industry body forecasts.\n\nDomestic prices have stayed above the state-set minimum purchase rate of 2,275 rupees per 100 kg, and have started rising recently.\n\nDEPLETED RESERVES\n\nWheat stocks in state warehouses dropped to 7.5 million metric tons in April, the lowest in 16 years, after the government was forced to sell more than 10 million tons, a record, to flour millers and biscuit makers to tame prices.\n\n""The removal of the import duty will help us ensure that our own reserves don\'t fall below a psychological benchmark of 10 million tons,"" said the government official.\n\nNew Delhi has struggled to replenish state wheat stocks.\n\nSince the harvest began in April, the government managed to buy only 26.2 million metric tons against a target of 30 million to 32 million.\n\nThat was despite its advice to trading houses to refrain from purchases to enable state stockpiler the Food Corporation of India to procure large quantities.\n\nState procurement is unlikely to cross 27 million metric tons, the New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading house said.\n\nNew Delhi needs nearly 18.5 million metric tons of wheat as part of the world\'s biggest food welfare programme.\n\nIndia\'s main opposition Congress party has promised a monthly supply of 10 kg of free grain to programme beneficiaries if voted to power, or double what Modi\'s government provides now.\n\nNew Delhi has resisted calls for wheat imports as overseas purchases risk angering farmers, an influential voting bloc, but the limitation ends with the mammoth six-week-long election.\n\n""Despite the recent rise in global prices, imports at zero duty are economically viable, and that\'s why the new government should remove the duty to enable the trade to import,"" said Kumar, the flour milling official.\n\nReporting by Mayank Bhardwaj and Rajendra Jadhav; Additional reporting by Naveen Thukral in Singapore; Editing by Tony Munroe and Clarence Fernandez'"

630,630,"b'NEW DELHI (AP) -- Millions of Indian voters across 93 constituencies were casting ballots on Tuesday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has mounted an increasingly shrill election campaign, ramping up polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that have targeted the Muslim minority.\n\nIn recent campaign rallies, Modi has called Muslims ""infiltrators"" and said they ""have too many children,"" referring to a Hindu nationalist trope that Muslims produce more children with the aim of outnumbering Hindus in India. He has also accused the rival Indian National Congress party of scheming to ""loot"" wealth from the country\'s Hindus and redistribute it among Muslims, who comprise 14% of India\'s more than 1.4 billion people.\n\nTuesday\'s polling in the third round of multi-phase national elections has crucial seats up for grabs in states including Karnataka, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Most polls predict a win for Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress and powerful regional parties. The staggered election will run until June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4.\n\nModi, who voted in western Ahmedabad city on Tuesday, had kicked off his campaign with a focus on economic progress, promising he would make India a developed nation by 2047. But in recent weeks, he and the ruling BJP have doubled down heavily on their Hindu nationalism platform, with Modi employing some of his most divisive rhetoric in his decade in power.\n\nAnalysts say the change in tone comes as the BJP aims to clinch a supermajority or two-thirds of the 543 seats up for grabs in India\'s lower Parliament by consolidating votes among the majority Hindu population, who make up 80%. They say Modi\'s party is also ratcheting up polarizing speeches to distract voters from larger issues, like unemployment and economic distress, that the opposition has focused on.\n\nWhile India\'s economy is among the world\'s fastest growing, many people face growing economic stress. The opposition alliance hopes to tap into this discontent, seeking to galvanize voters on issues like high unemployment, inflation, corruption and low agricultural prices, which have driven two years of farmers\' protests.\n\n""The mask has dropped, and I think it is political compulsions that have made them do this,"" said Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a political science professor at New Delhi\'s Ashoka University.\n\nChanges in the BJP\'s campaign may also be a sign of anxiety around low voter turnout it had not anticipated, Mahmudabad said. Voter turnout in the first two phases have been slightly lower than the same rounds in the last election in 2019, according to official data.\n\n""In recent elections, the BJP\'s wins have been associated with getting the voters out (to vote),"" Mahmudabad said. ""There may be some fatigue, anti-incumbency or even disenchantment,"" which has led the BJP to escalate their rhetoric.\n\nModi, in numerous speeches in recent weeks, has said women\'s wealth could be at risk if Congress comes to power, claiming the party would snatch away their ""mangalsutra"" -- a sacred gold chain that indicates a Hindu woman\'s marital status -- and give it to its voters, a veiled reference to Muslims. The opposition won\'t stop there, he has repeatedly claimed, saying the party was conspiring to take away ""your property"" and ""distribute it among selected people.""\n\nOthers in Modi\'s party have echoed his remarks. A recent video posted by the BJP on Instagram was more direct. The animated campaign video, which has since been taken down from the social media platform, said if the Congress party comes to power, it will take money and wealth from non-Muslims and redistribute it to Muslims.\n\nThe Congress party and other political opponents have characterized Modi\'s remarks as ""hate speech"" that could fan religious tensions. They have also filed complaints with India\'s election commission, which is overseeing the polls, for breaching rules that ban candidates from appealing to ""caste or communal feelings"" to secure votes.\n\nThe commission can issue warnings and suspend candidates for a period of time over violations of the code of conduct, but it has issued no warnings to Modi so far.\n\nModi\'s critics say India\'s tradition of diversity and secularism has come under attack since the prime minister and his party rose to power a decade ago. While there have long been tensions between India\'s majority Hindu community and Muslims, rights groups say that attacks against minorities have become more brazen under Modi.\n\nThe party denies the accusation and says its policies benefit all Indians.\n\nMahmudabad, the political scientist, said Modi\'s party had counted on getting votes from the fervor over a Hindu temple that was built atop a razed mosque that Modi opened in January. Many saw the glitzy spectacle as the unofficial start of his election campaign.\n\n""Instead, people are talking about inflation, unemployment and economic distress,"" Mahmudabad said. ""And so in order to galvanize and consolidate their vote, the BJP has raised the specter of Muslims.""'"
631,631,"b'AYODHYA, India (AP) -- Millions of Indians across 49 constituencies began casting ballots on Monday as the country\'s six-week-long election enters its final stages with voting also being held in northern Ayodhya city, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened a controversial Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nMonday\'s polling in the fifth round of multi-phase national elections across six states and two union territories is crucial for Modi\'s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The polls in Uttar Pradesh\'s Ayodhya are seen as a litmus test for Modi\'s Hindu-first politics, as he has hailed the opening of the Hindu temple as his government\'s crowning achievement.\n\nThe staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million eligible voters, more than 10% of the world\'s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years. The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4.\n\nModi last year opened the controversial Hindu temple built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu mobs in 1992. The temple was built at an estimated cost of $217 million and its opening was seen as a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state. It also fulfilled a longstanding demand of the majority Hindus.\n\nModi and his party, who have mixed religion and politics, hope that Hindu sentiment and fervor over the opening of the temple will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term. But experts say the issue may not be enough to rally the region\'s Hindu majority toward the BJP, particularly at a time when many Indians say they are affected by rising unemployment and inflation.\n\n""Issues like unemployment, inflation, lack of security and the government\'s attempts to muzzle dissent are glaring problems that the BJP has no answers to,"" said Amarnath Agarwal, a political analyst.\n\nAgarwal said excitement over the Hindu temple may not have translated into a significant political issue for the ruling party and it is ""evident from the lack of interest among voters, reflected in a notably low turnout.""\n\nWith two more phases of polling left, overall voter turnout has been lower than in previous elections. Some poll experts have suggested that some of Modi\'s party core supporters were staying away.\n\nMost polls show Modi and his party leading in the race for seats in the lower house of Parliament over their main challenger, a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties. However, it faces stiff resistance from the opposition, which appears to have tapped into discontent against Modi\'s government.\n\nShachindra Sharma, who votes Monday, said while the temple was a matter of faith for many Hindus like him, he would vote for a party that upholds constitutional values.\n\n""Why should the Ram Temple be a guiding factor for voters? Lord Ram is a matter of faith, while voting is a democratic process to elect a government. Is there any guarantee that a party advocating for the Ram Temple will provide security and lead the country towards progress?"" Sharma said.\n\nHis wife, Renuka Sharma, disagreed, arguing that the temple remains a crucial deciding factor in polls.\n\n""I will vote for the party that built the Ram Temple because Lord Ram is the biggest issue in this election,"" she said.\n\nModi\'s party has repeatedly reiterated the temple\'s centrality to the election narrative. He has also increasingly used anti-Muslim rhetoric in his campaign speeches.\n\nUttar Pradesh\'s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in an election rally last week, said the choice between ""devotees of Ram"" and""anti-Ram forces"" is the defining theme of the national election, referring to the opposition parties.\n\n""You should vote for devotees of Ram because they are the people who built Ram Temple for you,"" he said.\n\nModi has also capitalized on the emotive appeal of the temple among Hindus and sometimes falsely accused opposition parties of attempting to overturn the court\'s verdict that allowed its construction. On Friday, he claimed that if the opposition comes to power it will raze the temple.\n\nMonday\'s polling will also see opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty, running for office from Rae Bareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh state.\n\nGandhi also ran for office from Wayanad in southern India, which has already voted. India allows candidates to contest multiple constituencies but they can represent only one.'"
632,632,"b'When Balu Natarajan became the first Indian American champion of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985, a headline on an Associated Press article read, ""Immigrants\' son wins National Spelling Bee,"" with the first paragraph noting the champion ""speaks his parents\' native Indian language at home.""\n\nThose details would hardly be newsworthy today after a quarter-century of Indian American spelling champs, most of them the offspring of parents who arrived in the United States on student or work visas.\n\nThis year\'s bee is scheduled to begin Tuesday at a convention center outside Washington and, as usual, many of the expected contenders are Indian American, including Shradha Rachamreddy, Aryan Khedkar, Bruhat Soma and Ishika Varipilli.\n\nNearly 70% of Indian-born U.S. residents arrived after 2000, according to census data, and that dovetails with the surge in Indian American spelling bee champions. There were two Indian American Scripps winners before 1999. Of the 34 since, 28 have been Indian American, including three straight years of Indian American co-champions and one year (2019) when eight champions were declared, seven of Indian ancestry.\n\nThe experiences of first-generation Indian Americans and their spelling bee champion children illustrate the economic success and cultural impact of the nation\'s second-largest immigrant group.\n\nAs of 2022, there were 3.1 million Indian-born people living in the U.S., and Indian American households had a median income of $147,000, more than twice the median income of all U.S. households, according to census data. Indian Americans also were more than twice as likely to have college degrees.\n\nIndians received 74% of the H-1B visas for specialized occupations approved in fiscal 2021, and a record total of nearly 269,000 students from India were enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities in 2022-23, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nThose numbers paint a picture of a high-achieving demographic that is well-suited for success in academic competitions.\n\nGanesh Dasari, whose daughter and son each made multiple appearances at the Scripps bee, holds a doctorate in civil engineering from the University of Cambridge and was recruited to the U.S. to work for ExxonMobil on an H-1B visa. He quickly obtained a green card.\n\n""Me and my wife, we came from a similar background. We both benefited from having the education ... so we put a lot of emphasis on educating our kids,"" Dasari said. ""We basically introduced them to anything academic, and a couple of sports, but clearly there was a bias in our thinking that education is a higher priority than sports.""\n\nIn his 2016 address to Congress, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned ""spelling bee champions"" among his country\'s contributions to the U.S. while that year\'s co-champs, Nihar Janga and Jairam Hathwar, watched from the gallery.\n\nEven among Indian American spellers, a particular subgroup is overrepresented: families from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where Telugu is the primary language. Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, is India\'s information-technology hub and the region supplies many H-1B visa recipients.\n\n""Whenever we go to the spelling bee events, everybody speaks that language,"" Dasari said. ""We realized there are so many people from the same state.""\n\nDeval Shah, the father of last year\'s champion, Dev Shah, grew up in the northwestern state of Gujarat and proudly noted Dev was the first spelling bee champion of Gujarati descent. The parents of the 2022 winner, Harini Logan, are from Chennai in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Shah is an engineer, his wife is a physician, and both of Harini\'s parents were trained as software engineers.\n\nIndian-born parents of kids with an affinity for spelling have a network of similar families to provide guidance and support, as well as access to organizations like the North South Foundation, which offers academic competitions aimed at the Indian diaspora.\n\n""The reason Indian American immigrants really dominate, the main reason is the North South Foundation,"" Shah said.\n\nWhen Harini won her first NSF spelling competition, Ganesh Dasari was one of the judges, and ""he was literally chasing us down"" to tell them ""Harini has tremendous potential to be on the national stage,"" said Rampriya Logan, Harini\'s mother.\n\nIshika, a 13-year-old from Spring, Texas, who will be competing at Scripps this year for the third time, woke her parents at 6 a.m. the day after she lost a third-grade classroom spelling bee, saying she wanted to participate in more bees. Her mother, an IT manager who immigrated to the U.S. in 2006, then reached out to ask advice from other families from the Houston area whose children were high-level spellers.\n\nThe relative wealth and stability of Indian American households could lead observers to conclude their children are benefiting primarily from a privileged upbringing. The truth is more nuanced, said Devesh Kapur, a professor of South Asian Studies at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of ""The Other One Percent: Indians in America.""\n\n""It is important to note that the children participating in the spelling bee competition come from striving middle-class immigrant families, often in occupations like IT, and not from wealthier Indian American households in finance or tech start-ups or consulting,"" Kapur said.\n\nNatarajan, a Chicago-based physician and health care executive, now serves as the volunteer president of the NSF, and he experienced the spelling bee as a parent when his son, Atman Balakrishnan, competed. He said he sometimes feels out of place because he was born in the U.S. and he admires the grit of Indian-born parents and their children.\n\n""It\'s hard to describe, but it\'s a very specific mindset that just drives effort and in many ways drives outcomes and sustainable success,"" Natarajan said.\n\nBen Nuckols has covered the Scripps National Spelling Bee since 2012.

633,633,"b'MALAPPURAM, India (AP) -- Preventing Muslim migrants from gaining citizenship. Revoking the semi-autonomy of the country\'s only Muslim-majority region. Building a Hindu temple where a violent mob razed a mosque.\n\nThese were political triumphs for Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the past decade, burnishing his reputation as a leader who prioritizes the interests India\'s Hindu majority. For India\'s 200 million Muslims, they highlight their waning political power in the world\'s largest democracy.\n\nTensions between Hindus and Muslims in India are not new, but they have gotten worse under Modi, whose ruling Bharatiya Janata Party touts a Hindu-nationalist ideology. And with Modi seemingly on the cusp of a third five-year term, the outlook for Muslim politicians -- and citizens -- is bleak. This year\'s vote will be decided in June.\n\nIt\'s not just that Modi has ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric in campaign speeches. Ever since the BJP began its rise as a political force in the mid-1980s, the proportion of Muslim lawmakers in parliament and state legislatures has shrunk.\n\nMuslim representation has fallen in the ruling BJP, and in opposition parties, too.\n\nWhen Modi assumed power in 2014, the outgoing parliament had 30 Muslim lawmakers -- and just one was a member of the BJP. Muslims now hold 25 out of 543 seats, and none belong to the BJP.\n\nIndia has gone from being a country where Muslims were largely marginalized to one where they are ""actively excluded,"" said Ali Khan Mahmudabad, a political scientist and historian at New Delhi\'s Ashoka University.\n\n""Without representation, you are unable to ask the state for resources and articulate the kind of needs the community has in order to progress, whether its education, jobs, health or basic infrastructure,"" Mahmudabad said.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Muslims accounted for 11% of India\'s population, and had 9% of seats in parliament; today they are 14% of the population and have less than 5% of seats in parliament.\n\nNine out of 10 members in parliament are Hindus, who make up 80 percent of India\'s population of 1.4 billion.\n\nThe political representation of Muslims at the state level is only slightly better. India has more than 4,000 lawmakers in state legislatures across 28 states and Muslim lawmakers hold roughly 6% of these seats.\n\nA government report in 2006 found Muslims lagged Hindus, Christians and people from India\'s lower castes in literacy, income and access to education. They have made some gains since then but are still at a significant disadvantage, according to multiple independent studies.\n\nUnder Modi\'s decade in power, the BJP has enacted or proposed various laws that Muslim leaders consider discriminatory.\n\n-- Some states ruled by the BJP passed laws restricting interfaith marriage as a way to address what they claim is the threat posed by Hindu women marrying Muslim men and then converting.\n\n-- One state formerly ruled by the BJP banned girls from wearing hijabs in school. (The law was reversed after the BJP lost political control.)\n\n-- The BJP is advocating a common legal code that would affect some religious practices, by changing some laws in India\'s constitution that deal with matters ranging from marriage to divorce and inheritance.\n\nViolence against Muslims is commonplace, and Modi has said little to deter it. Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs over allegations of eating beef or smuggling cows, an animal considered holy to Hindus. Their homes and businesses have been bulldozed, and their places of worship set on fire.\n\nAt recent campaign rallies, Modi has said Muslims are ""infiltrators"" and that they ""have too many children."" Without evidence, he has accused the BJP\'s main rival, the Congress party, of planning to redistribute the wealth of Hindus to Muslims.\n\nMany Muslims believe Modi is stoking divisions as a campaign strategy.\n\n""They\'re keeping the Hindu-Muslim issue hot... so they remain enemies,"" said Mehmood Bhai Khatri, a 64-year-old Muslim voter from Modi\'s home state of Gujarat, a BJP stronghold.\n\n""But who will speak up? If they do, they may be picked up (by police) or a bulldozer will be sent to their homes,"" said Khatri. ""So out of fear, nobody speaks up.""\n\nNot one of India\'s 28 states has a Muslim as chief minister; the BJP and its allies have chief ministers in 19 states.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the country\'s most populous state and where roughly 16% of residents are Muslim, just 7% of state lawmakers are Muslim.\n\nAs the BJP becomes ever more powerful, India\'s opposition parties have become increasingly reluctant to nominate Muslim candidates for fear of alienating Hindu voters, experts say.\n\nWhile Hindus overwhelmingly rally around the BJP, Muslims have struggled to form a cohesive political agenda, in part because of how diverse their community is across sects, ethnicity, language, customs, and culture.\n\n""There is no way to unite this very heterogeneous group of people, without making Islam the common denominator,"" said Mahmudabad, the political scientist.\n\nBut when political parties don\'t field enough Muslims, issues important to them -- from minority rights to hate speech -- hardly ever get debated reach in the parliament, said Muhammad Saad, a cab driver in New Delhi who is Muslim.\n\n""If there are no Muslims in the parliament, who will raise the voice for us?"" Saad questioned.\n\nAnalysts say the BJP has made some outreach efforts to Muslims, such as seeking their help as volunteers and at the polls. But the party fielded just 13 Muslim candidates combined in the 2014 and 2019 elections, and none were elected.\n\nThe BJP denies discriminating against Muslim people.\n\nThe party ""permits accommodation of all kinds of people, not just the Hindus,"" said M Abdul Salam, the only Muslim out of some 430 BJP candidates running for parliament this year. If he wins, he will become the first Muslim member of the BJP since 2014 in India\'s lower house of the parliament.\n\nSalam, who is from the Muslim-majority southern city of Malappuram, said Muslim politicians from other parties could gain power by joining the BJP\'s alliance in parliament.\n\nBut Muslims from other parties are struggling simply to stay in office.\n\nS T Hasan, a Muslim member of parliament from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, was not chosen by the Samajwadi Party to seek reelection. He was replaced by a Hindu politician, a decision he believes was made to appeal to Hindu voters, who are the majority in the region he represents.\n\nHasan said political parties, especially those that consider themselves secular, need to make more room for minority candidates.\n\n""Fair representation of every community is good for a democracy,"" he said. ""But what we are seeing is that one community is being gradually pushed to the corner.""'"

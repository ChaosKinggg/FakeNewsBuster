0,0,"b'Britain goes to the polls next week in a general election that looks set to end 14 years of Conservative rule marked by economic turbulence, Brexit, political scandal and upheaval.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak\'s right-wing Tories are expected to be dumped out of power, with discontent appearing widespread about their record in government and the state of the country.\n\nSunak has been unable to narrow a gaping 20-point polling deficit to Keir Starmer\'s centre-left Labour party, during a largely lacklustre election campaign.\n\nSome predictions put the Conservatives on course for the worst results in their 200-year history and forecast a record majority for Labour, last in office under Gordon Brown in 2010.\n\nOne survey even suggested that Sunak could become the first sitting UK prime minister to lose his own seat.\n\nVoting begins at 7:00 am (0600 GMT) next Thursday and runs until 10:00 pm, with official results trickling in late into the night and early morning.\n\nIncreasingly, the electorate is tipped to send a message to the Conservatives that their time is up, with some Tories already indicating that they can only mitigate the size of Labour\'s win.\n\n""The country is a mess,"" said Tom Lough, an 82-year-old Tory voter in Richmond, northern England, where Sunak is standing for re-election.\n\n""They\'re just not good enough,"" added another Conservative supporter, Bruce Walker, 67, accusing the party of abandoning its values of low taxation and strength on security and immigration.\n\n- \'Broken Britain\' -\n\nDavid Cameron brought the Conservatives to power in 2010, imposing tough austerity measures in the aftermath of the global financial crash, hitting the funding of public services -- and people\'s pockets.\n\nCameron then gambled on appeasing anti-European right-wingers in the party by calling a vote on European Union membership that backfired on him when the public narrowly voted to leave in 2016.\n\nBrexit and what form it should take claimed the premierships first of Cameron, who backed ""remain"", then his successor Theresa May, who failed to get her divorce deal sanctioned by parliament.\n\nBoris Johnson, who took over, managed it with an 80-seat majority following a snap election in 2019, but he was brought down by his handling of the Covid crisis, and claims of corruption and cronyism.\n\nLiz Truss\'s brief tenure in September and October 2022 ended after her unfunded tax-cutting plans spooked the markets and crashed the pound.\n\nSunak, the party\'s fifth leader and prime minister since 2010, has tried to revive its fortunes, vowing to bring down sky-high inflation and cut record levels of immigration.\n\nBut he has struggled to quell public anger at the higher cost of living, frustration with lengthy waits for health appointments, pared-back public services and creaking infrastructure.\n\n""Nothing works in this country anymore and no one in government cares,"" Trades Union Congress leader Paul Nowak said last September. ""The Conservatives have broken Britain.""\n\n- \'Change\' -\n\nBelief in the Tories is wavering even in the predominantly Conservative-supporting national press.\n\n""Almost everything is getting worse, and almost nothing is getting better,"" wrote columnist Allister Heath in the Daily Telegraph earlier this year, although he predicted that things would not get better under Labour.\n\nOther political commentators are predicting that the country is at a historic ""inflection point"" and has a chance to reset, even if Starmer is not promising radical reform.\n\nFive years ago, under veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, Labour stood on a hard-left manifesto of huge public spending and renationalisation, and suffered its worst election defeat since 1935.\n\nStarmer, a former human rights lawyer and chief public prosecutor, took over in 2020 and set about ending ideological infighting that had hobbled the party\'s electoral prospects.\n\nHe also took action against claims of anti-Semitism, expelling even Corbyn himself as part of a plan to take the party back to the centre ground.\n\n""We have campaigned as changed Labour and we will govern as changed Labour,"" Starmer, 61, told the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail in an interview published on Wednesday.\n\nBut the party\'s promise of ""change"" is predicted to be a struggle, particularly with the country\'s public finances constrained.\n\nThe Tories have run a negative campaign, warning about Labour profligacy and higher taxes, and promising tougher action on immigration and security.\n\nTheir share of the right-wing vote could be split with the anti-immigration Reform UK party of Brexit champion Nigel Farage, which could spell years in the political wilderness.'"
1,1,"b'Nepali Prime Minister and former Maoist guerrilla commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a parliamentary vote of confidence on Friday barely 18 months after taking office, throwing open the Himalayan republic\'s revolving door leadership.\n\nBetter known by his nom de guerre Prachanda (""The Fierce One""), Dahal led thousands of insurgents during Nepal\'s decade-long civil war but switched to parliamentary politics at the conflict\'s end.\n\nThe 69-year-old was elected prime minister for a third time in December 2022 but will be forced to stand down again after coalition allies withdrew their support.\n\n""Someone like Prachanda, who opens the doors of peace with the power of a revolution, may not be born again,"" Dahal said, referring to himself in the third person during a speech urging lawmakers to keep him in office.\n\nHe was able to win the support of only 63 MPs among the 258 present to vote on the future of his government.\n\nDahal will remain in office under a caretaker government until a parliamentary vote to elect his replacement, expected as early as Sunday.\n\nHis brief tenure was nonetheless one of the longest continuous premierships since Nepal\'s monarchy was abolished in 2008 at the end of the civil war.\n\nOnly three other prime ministers had served in office longer than him over that period, and of those only one lasted more than two years.\n\nDahal himself had served as premier on two earlier occasions for less than a year at a time.\n\nHis Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) was the third-largest party in parliament after the 2022 poll but he managed to remain in power through deft negotiating.\n\nThree-time premier K.P. Sharma Oli, head of the larger Communist Party of Nepal - Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) is expected to form the next government with the backing of the centre-left Nepali Congress.\n\nOli, 72, is then expected to yield the post to Congress leader and five-time prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, 78, later in the parliamentary term under a deal negotiated between the two parties.\n\n- \'Breaking promises\' -\n\nPolitical journalist Kunda Dixit told AFP that the alliance between Deuba and Oli may prove more stable because they represented the largest two parties in parliament and were ""not so ideologically opposed"" to each other.\n\n""But we have seen leaders breaking promises and back-stabbing each other in the past, so anything is possible,"" he added.\n\nDahal\'s Maoists have played a key role in Nepal\'s politics for more than 20 years, after waging a decade-long insurgency against government forces that claimed more than 16,000 lives.\n\nThe civil war ended in a 2006 peace deal that abolished Nepal\'s monarchy and saw the Maoists brought into government, with Dahal the first post-war premier.\n\nSince then, a revolving door of ageing prime ministers and a culture of horse-trading have fuelled public perceptions that the government is out of touch with Nepal\'s pressing problems.\n\nThe Himalayan nation of 30 million people is sandwiched between powerful neighbours India and China -- with both New Delhi and Beijing jostling for influence.\n\nIts economy has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic, which devastated the vital tourism industry and dried up remittances from the huge number of Nepalis working abroad.'"

5,5,"b""New Delhi: The Rouse Avenue court on Friday reserved an order on the framing of the charges in a Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) case against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in the Pul Bangash Sikh killing case.\n\nThe court is likely to pronounce an order on charges on August 2. This case pertains to the killing of Sikhs in the Pul Bangash area in 1984.\n\nSpecial CBI judge Rakesh Siyal, after submissions and clarifications by counsel for the CBI and Jagdish Tytler, reserved an order on the framing of charges. The CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in May last year.\n\nDuring arguments, defence counsel Manu Sharma placed on record a video of the Doordarshan shoot at Teen Murthy House, where the dead body of Indira Gandhi was kept.\n\nDefence counsel argued that, as per the video, Tytler was present at Teen Murthy House on the day of the alleged incident. This claim was disputed by the CBI and senior advocate, HS Phoolka, counsel for the riot victim. The CBI also referred to the statement of Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nManu Sharma argued that the CBI had filed three closure reports. The CBI filed a charge sheet against co-accused Suresh Kumar Panewala in 2009. He was acquitted by the trial court.\n\nIt was also argued that since 1984 till 2022-23, there have been no witnesses. After a long period of 40 years, witnesses are coming forward. How can they be trusted, he argued.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation on April 16 concluded its arguments on framing of charges. The CBI had said that there were eyewitnesses who saw Jagdish Tytler inciting the mob during the 1984 riots. There is sufficient material to frame charges against the accused, Jagdish Tytler.\n\nDuring his arguments, CBI's Counsel read over the statements of four eyewitnesses, including Surender Singh, who saw the accused inciting the mob after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nThis case is related to the alleged killing of three Sikhs, Thakur Singh, Badal Singh and Gurcharan Singh in front of Pul Bangash Gurudwara on November 1, 1984. Congress leader Jagdish Tytler is accused.\n\nThe CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against him on May 20, 2023. On August 5, Tytler appeared before the court against the summons issued by the court after taking cognizance of the supplementary charge sheet. Thereafter, he appeared through video conferencing.\n\nEarlier, he was granted anticipatory bail on August 4, 2023, by the session court after hearing his bail application.\n\nOn May 20, the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a chargesheet against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in a case related to anti-Sikh riots in 1984, following the assassination of the then Prime Minister of India on October 31, 1984.\n\nCongress leader Jagdish Tytler, then Member of Parliament, has been named as accused in the chargesheet. In a statement, the CBI mentioned that the agency had registered the instant case in November 2005 on an incident wherein Gurudwara Pul Bangash at Azad Market, Bara Hindu Rao, Delhi, was set on fire by a mob, and three persons, namely Sardar Thakur Singh, Badal Singh and Gurcharan Singh were burned to death on November 1, 1984, near Gurudwara Pul Bangash.\n\nThe Justice Nanavati Commission of Inquiry was set up in the year 2000 by the Government of India to inquire into the incidents of anti-Sikh riots of the year 1984 in Delhi. After consideration of the Commission's report, the Ministry of Home Affairs (Government of India) issued directions to the CBI to investigate the case against the then Member of Parliament and others.\n\nDuring the CBI investigation, evidence came on record that on November 1, 1984, the said accused allegedly instigated, incited and provoked the mob assembled at Gurudwara Pul Bangash at Azad Market, Delhi, which resulted in the burning of Gurudwara Pul Bangash and the killing of three Sikh persons by the mob, apart from burning and looting of shops."""

The Bill proposes fee on transactions and penalties for non-compliance. It aims to protect workers\' rights and ensure basic social security. It is inspired by Rajasthan law and includes grievance redressal mechanism and prevention of illegal termination. the Bill promises welfare board, fund for gig workers. Discussions have been held with major platforms and International Labour Organisation for input.Karnataka has come up with a draft Bill to mandate app-based delivery and ride-hailing platforms to give social security benefits to gig workers and proposing other welfare measures. The state government has placed the draft in public domain seeking comments from stakeholders.\n\nThe draft Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024 proposes a fee on each transaction on the platforms. For non-compliance with its provisions, the draft law suggests a monetary penalty.\n\nThis proposed Bill is an improvised version over the Rajasthan law, labour minister Santosh Lad told ET. Rajasthan, by passing a Bill in July last year, became the first state in the country to introduce a law for platform workers.\n\n""Ours is a rights-based Bill aiming to protect the rights of the gig and platform workers,"" he said.\n\nThe proposed Bill is intended to ensure basic minimum social security for workers. It seems to end arbitrary illegal termination of employees, the minister said.\n\nThe rules will follow after the legislature passes the Bill.\n\nAhead of the assembly polls in May last year, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi interacted with gig workers in Bengaluru, discussing their issues and taking a 2 km ride with a delivery partner on his vehicle.\n\nThe Congress party had, in its assembly election manifesto, promised a gig workers\' welfare board and minimum hourly wage for workers in the unorganised sector.\n\nBengaluru is estimated to have about 200,000 gig workers on Dunzo, Swiggy, Blinkit and other delivery platforms. Two years ago, gig workers from Dunzo had protested when the platform introduced an incentive-based model of payment for its delivery agents. The move had effectively slashed the per-delivery payments. The proposed law promises a grievance redressal mechanism and seeks to prevent arbitrary and illegal termination.\n\nThe draft Bill is the outcome of several rounds of discussion with the aggregators and a conference held in collaboration with the International Labour Organization. Labour department officials said they have put out the draft law after discussions with platforms including Amazon, Flipkart, Uber, Ola, Rapido, Zomato, and Dunzo.\n\nThe government has said that every platform-based gig worker and aggregator must register with the labour department. The aggregator must also enter into a fair compensation agreement as per the contract guidelines and templates the government would notify.\n\nThe proposed Bill promises a Platform Workers Welfare Board to monitor registration of platforms with the government and that they comply with other regulations. There will also be a welfare fund, to be raised through the fee on each online transaction or a levy on the annual turnover of the aggregators, contributions from gig workers, grants from the government and other donations.\n\nThe draft law seeks transparency in algorithm control through automated monitoring and decision-making systems.'"

Locals and organisations are miffed by the district administrations\' decision.\n\nThe statue was removed as part of the Doom Doom\'s makeover project which included building a clock tower and replacing the old statue with another statue.\n\nThe statue was installed in town during the chairmanship of Late Ram Bachan Singh in 1960, it was a town committee that now has become a Municipal Board. The statue was installed over a well. Doom Dooma town has several wells.\n\nOfficials in the board said that statue was then brought from Gujarat. ""One side of the spectacles of the statue was damaged and there were a couple of damages that have crept in the statue over the years. The face of the statue was facing the old AT Raad which is no longer the entry point of Doom Dooma town.""\n\nSarma, reacting to a post by Mahatma\'s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi, wrote on X: ""I am not aware of this decision taken by the district administration. Let me verify the facts.""

23,23,"b'Budget coaltion parties: India\'s Budget for this fiscal year focused on fiscal prudence with record capex allocation and major tax changes. It allocated funds to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, key allies of the ruling party. Opposition criticised the Budget as \'discriminatory.\' However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman defended it as honoring commitments and addressing long-standing issues. Unemployment measures were highlighted as non-political. Opposition\'s claims of lack of funds for certain states were dismissed as misleading by Sitharaman.India\'s Budget for this fiscal year stuck to fiscal prudence while retaining its record capex allocation, while it made major changes to tax structures ranging from income taxes (under new regime) to removing indexation benefits, and tweaking capital gains tax and STT on F&O that had for a while rattled the stock markets.\n\nWhat the Budget also did is it allocated thousands of crores to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, the two states ruled by Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar who are the key allies for Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA alliance as Prime Miniser Narendra Modi returned to power for a third straight term but with a weaker mandate as BJP failed to secure a majority on its own.\n\nSoon after the Budget was announced, where Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to give Rs 15,000 crore to Andhra Pradesh for the development of its capital city Amaravati and allocated over Rs 60,000 crore for various projects in Bihar, the Opposition political parties rushed to criticise the Budget and also called it to be \'discriminatory\'.\n\nThe Modi government did not agree to big demands like giving special status to Bihar, but it made announcements to keep its allies happy. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised the government for trying to please its NDA allies through the Budget. He called Modi\'s first Budget of his third term a ""Kursi Bachao"" Budget. Gandhi accused the government of making empty promises to allies while neglecting other states.\n\nHowever, Sitharaman defended it in the parliament, and in an interview to ToI she highlighted the Budget is more about continuity and commitment over political gamesmanship.\n\n""This budget has every continuity from the interim budget, nothing has been dropped, everything has continued, though newer things have been added. When you say it is political, you refer to projects we have taken up for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But we did that for a reason,"" Sitharaman told ToI. She said that the allocations are based on long-standing commitments, not just recent election results.\n\nA significant portion of the budget is allocated to Andhra Pradesh for projects like the Polavaram irrigation project and state development, as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.\n\n""The AP Reorganisation Act must be honoured. We have been doing it since 2014,"" she said.\n\nSitharaman said that some projects, such as Polavaram, had faced delays but has now been approved as a national project and will receive funding. She also mentioned that Andhra Pradesh, being the only state without a capital, will be provided with financial support. According to Sitharaman, these additions are not new initiatives but longstanding commitments that need to be addressed after 10 years of delay.\n\n""In Bihar\'s case, can anyone deny the devastation that happens because of Kosi flooding?,"" Sitharaman said.\n\nThe budget includes measures to build barrages to reduce flooding, addressing long-standing issues rather than seeking electoral benefits, the finance minister said.\n\nWhile India\'s budget took several measures to ramp up employment, Sitharaman said the focus on jobs was not political and shows the government\'s consistent efforts to address unemployment in a country where the job crisis continues to be a political hot button.\n\nWhen asked if the interim budget could have been more politically advantageous, Sitharaman said she can\'t assess that because she sees the budget as a reflection of the government\'s work,. The interim budget, according to her, was a practical document to ensure government operations continued smoothly and took care of expenditure until the new administration took over.\n\nThe demand for special status by states like Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha is another contentious issue. Sitharaman mentioned past assessments by the 14th Finance Commission and the Raghuram Rajan committee, which found such categorisation unsustainable. ""There\'s nothing more I can add to that,"" she said.\n\nPolitical slugfests in India have also revolved around Modi criticising the opposition parties doling out \'revdis, or freebies, in the name of welfare measures to woo voters.\n\nSitharaman said that while many parties understand the long-term unsustainability of such measures, there is often a lack of political honesty in acknowledging this.\n\n""In a public position, who is answerable for taxpayers, you have to be clear that collecting tax from someone and paying it to somebody else, however deserving that person may be, should be sustainable,"" Sitharaman said, adding there has to be a balance between political pragmatism and fiscal responsibility.\n\nThe opposition\'s most pointed criticism is the alleged lack of funds for certain states. Sitharaman dismisses these claims as ""100% blatant misinformation,"" accusing the opposition, especially Congress, of spreading misleading narratives.\n\n""The opposition, particularly Congress, is brazenly pushing this methodology of building a narrative which is not backed by facts, or backed by partial facts. They hide what has happened during their govts...This brazen method of building a false narrative, repeating it and restating it with the hope that it will stick has been tried in the Lok Sabha elections. They are trying it even now,"" Sitharaman said.'"

Their call for change comes after they were co-recipients of the Kirti Chakra, India\'s second-highest gallantry honor, awarded to Captain Singh posthumously.\n\nThe term next of kin typically refers to a soldier\'s spouse, adopted family member, or closest living blood relative.

Baghel denied Pandey\'s accusations of operating a Rs 6,000 crore betting scheme during his tenure, pointing out that his government had taken action against the app\'s promoters. Baghel also expressed concerns over the app\'s continued operation under the current administration and plans to address the issue further.Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday slammed BJP MP Santosh Pandey for his statement in Lok Sabha over the alleged Mahadev app scam and wondered why the betting platform had not been banned by the BJP-led Central and state governments. The senior Congress leader said he would write a letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker against Pandey who made baseless allegations in Parliament.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pandey, representing Rajnandgaon parliamentary seat in Chhattisgarh, in a veiled attack on Baghel accused him of operating a betting operation worth over Rs 6,000 crore in the name of Lord Mahadev during his tenure as Chief Minister.\n\nIn response, Baghel stated that when he was heading the state government (2018-2023), more than 70 FIRs were registered, hundreds of individuals were arrested, and assets including money, mobiles, and laptops worth crores were seized in connection with the Mahadev online betting app.\n\n""Rajnandgaon MP Pandey has levelled serious allegations against me in Parliament saying the former CM was operating betting worth Rs 6,000 crore through the Mahadev app. The allegation is baseless,"" he stated.\n\nThe government has changed, but the Mahadev app is still operational even though the BJP is in power in the state and Centre. Are they now going to name it \'Vishnu Deo Sai app\'? he questioned while targeting Chief Minister Sai.\n\nEven though the BJP is in power at the Centre and state, the app is yet to be banned and it is still operational, Baghel added.\n\n""We (the previous Congress government) had issued a lookout circular (against the promoters of the app). They (the app\'s promoters) are in a foreign country and it (BJP-led Centre) is not able to catch and repatriate them,"" he said.\n\nBaghel also mentioned his plans to seek legal advice and take further action accordingly.\n\n""I will write a letter to the Speaker of Lok Sabha about the baseless allegations being raised against a person who is not a member of the House,"" he added.\n\nNotably, Chhattisgarh\'s Economic Offence Wing/Anti Corruption Bureau has named Baghel, along with the app\'s promoters Ravi Uppal, Saurabh Chandrakar, Shubham Soni, Anil Kumar Agrawal, and 14 others as accused in the betting app scandal.\n\nThe newly-elected BJP government lodged the case in March based on a report by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has been probing the money laundering aspect of the case for over a year.\n\nThe ED has filed three charge sheets in the Mahadev app-related money laundering case in Raipur court, including against the main promoters Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal. Multiple raids were conducted by the ED in connection with the case in Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe ED\'s investigation revealed the involvement of various high-ranking politicians and bureaucrats from Chhattisgarh, where Chandrakar and Uppal hail from.\n\nAccording to the ED, the Mahadev online gaming and betting app is an umbrella syndicate that arranges online platforms for illegal betting websites, enrols new users, creates user IDs, and launders money through a complex web of benami bank accounts.\n\nThe ED has arrested 11 persons so far. The two main promoters of the app were stated to have been detained in Dubai based on Interpol\'s red notice on ED\'s request.\n\nBhupesh Baghel had earlier termed the ED\'s action in the Mahadev betting app case as a ""political conspiracy"" and accused the federal agency of acting at the behest of its ""political masters"".'"

Chako was the only teacher aware of his side venture.\n\nHe has not graduated college yet, but this 21-year-old has already become the toast of his university and hometown. Sayooj S Chandran, a final-year undergraduate student, became a celebrity of sorts at St Pius X College in Rajapuram, a remote hill village in Kasaragod when he revealed he had splurged a whopping Rs 10 lakh on a new car. These were the earns he made by tutoring IAS exam hopefuls online.\n\nSayooj, unbeknownst to his college teachers and friends, operated a thriving IAS coaching channel on YouTube. His tutorials covered a wide array of subjects including current affairs, the civil service aptitude test (CSAT), history, geography, and general studies. Within months of opening the channel, he gained more than 10K views on his videos.\n\nIn an interview with Onmanorama, the youngster revealed what inspired him to take up coaching. He claimed that he had started teaching fellow aspirants, as he hoped to retain all the information he had learned. ""I initially started the channel as a way to share what I learned with other aspirants so that I would not forget what I learned. A way to revise,"" he stated. Sayooj will appear for his first Civil Service Examination (CSE) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in May 2025.\n\nHis YouTube channel IAS Hub Malayalam boasts of 2.1K subscribers. Dr Asha Chako, the head of the Department Of Chemistry revealed that his students included clerks college teachers, IT professionals, chemical engineers, homemakers and fellow college students. Chako was the only teacher who was aware of his side hustle.\n\nSayooj\'s father, P Chandran (59), retired from the Army, while his mother, Sathi Chandran (49), serves as both a social worker and an MNREGS supervisor. Sayooj attended Chattanchal Higher Secondary School in Chemnad panchayat and Swamijis Higher Secondary School in his village, Edneer, Chengala panchayat. After completing class 12 in 2022, he aimed to pursue a medical career by attempting the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) but did not succeed.\n\nIn the same year, Sayooj enrolled at St Pius X College in Rajapuram, Kallar panchayat, about 35km from his home, with an initial interest in microbiology. However, his aspirations shifted towards becoming an IAS officer during his time in college. To stay informed, he subscribed to e-papers of two English dailies.\n\nHe quickly realised that vocabulary was not his strong point, so made it a point to read books. He also started watching English movies and listening to the speeches of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor.\n\nIn eight months, Sayooj extensively covered courses on current affairs, aptitude tests, history, geography, and general studies offered by \'Physics Wallah\' on YouTube. He began studying sociology because microbiology wasn\'t an optional subject for the Civil Services Examination (CSE). Additionally, he completed the NCERT syllabus spanning classes 6 to 12, noting that approximately 90 percent of General Studies questions are based on this curriculum.\n\nTo maintain his edge, Sayooj reads two newspapers on his iPad during his 7 am bus ride to college and during breaks throughout the day, ensuring he finishes both papers before his return home at around 7 pm. At home, he synthesizes news reports into notes, creates video presentations, and uploads them to his channel. He then shares the links with subscribers via WhatsApp and Telegram groups.\n\nInitially, Sayooj named his initiative \'SC IAS Academy\' after himself, but later decided that ""academy"" sounded too grandiose.

He pulled out an image of Lord Shiva, saying he wanted to show the image as there are ideas in the image which he and the opposition defend. ""The first idea in the image we defend is the idea of confronting fears and never being scared,"" he said. An idea he spoke of was abhaya mudra which he said was also the symbol of the Congress party.\n\n""Abhaya mudra is the symbol of Congress. The Abhaya mudra is the gesture of fearlessness, is the gesture of reassurance and safety, which dispels fear and accords divine protection and bliss in Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism and other Indian religions.

But when Indira Gandhi launched her own faction, INC (R), after being expelled from the party by then Congress party president S. Nijalingappa, it was represented by a new election symbol - a cow with a suckling calf. On the other hand, the ""Old Congress"" (which had the support of only a few MPs), retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke.\n\nThe party\'s current election symbol was used by Indira Gandhi for the first time when she split from the Congress (R) faction following 1977 elections and created the new Congress (I)\n\nBased on popular but unconfirmed accounts, an interesting story lies behind how Indira got to choose the symbol.\n\nAfter imposing Emergency in the country, Indira suffered defeat in general elections and was even imprisoned on the charges of corruption. However, she regained power and became prime minister again in 1980.

The Mahant of Deoraha Baba Ashram, Shyam, had told TOI in 2019 how Indira had come to seek Baba\'s blessings. ""In 1978, Indira Gandhi came here and took blessings of Baba. She changed her party\'s symbol from cow and calf to open palm and won the election,"" he said\n\nDuring her meeting, Baba gave her a blessing by raising his hands and said \'Yahi haath tumhara bhala karega (this hand will do you good)\' and it seems that she took it seriously and made open hand her party\'s symbol,"" Shyam claimed, though it has never been verified if Indira indeed chose the hand symbol due to Baba\'s blessing.\n\nBaba was also known as ageless yogi. He used to live on a 12-foot high wooden platform on the bank of the river and typically blessed people with a touch of his foot on their heads. People across castes and religions came to him from far and wide and considered him their spiritual guru. Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia had also visited Baba on the eve of 1989 elections. Baba left the world on May 19, 1990.\n\nInclusion of Baba in the list of the accused in the Babri demolition case by the Liberhan Commission, even though he had left the world two years before the demolition, had angered a lot of people, especially saints and priests in Ayodhya, given Baba\'s image of a saint who blessed everyone irrespective of caste, religion or economic status and transcended these divides.\n\n(With inputs from TOI)'"

This is also the first time that a husband and wife -- CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and Kamlesh Thakur -- would sit in the house. Kamlesh Thakur\'s win from Dehra assembly seat has taken the number of women legislators in the state to two.\n\nIn the 2022 assembly elections, three Independents namely Hoshiyar Singh (Dehra), Ashish Sharma (Hamirpur) and K L Thakur (Nalagarh) were elected but they resigned after voting for BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan in Rajya Sabha election on February 27.\n\nThe Independent MLAs resigned on March 22 and joined the BJP the next day. Their resignation was accepted by Speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania on June 3 and by-elections were held on July 10.\n\nAll three former Independents legislators got tickets from the BJP but lost to Congress in two seats while the BJP won one seat.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Chief Minister Sukhu had maintained that the Independent MLAs did not need to resign as ""they can support or oppose any party"" and questioned why they sought re-election after 15 months when they did not have to.\n\nThe Independent MLAs have played an important role in the state\'s electoral politics. Sixteen independents were elected in 1967 while 12 independents were elected in 1957, eight in 1952, seven each in 1972 and 1993, six each in 1977, 1982 and 2003, five in 2012, three each in 1962, 2007 and 2022, two each in 1985 and 2017 and one each in 1990 and 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Romesh Dhawala who was the lone Independent MLA, emerged king maker as the Congress with Dhawala\'s support and BJP-HVC (Himachal Vikas Congress) combine had 32 members each in the house which had an effective strength of 64. Elections in three snowbound tribal constituencies were slated for June while in another seat BJP MLA Varinder Kumar died before taking oath, necessitating a by-election.\n\nBeing the leader of the single-largest party, Governor V S Ramadevi invited Congress leader Virbhadra Singh to form the government on March 6, 1998 and Dhawala was inducted as a cabinet minister.\n\nHowever, Virbhadra Singh announced his resignation in the house on March 12 without facing the floor test and the assembly was held in suspended animation by the governor.\n\nIn the meantime, Dhawala extended support to BJP-HVC combine and the governor asked the BJP to form the government and Prem Kumar Dhumal took oath as chief minister on March 24, and Dhawala was inducted as a minister in his cabinet.\n\nLater that year, BJP-HVC won all four seats in the bypolls and the strength of the ruling alliance rose to 36 and the government lasted the full term.\n\nIn this year\'s Rajya Sabha election, too, after both candidates got 34 votes each, the support of three independents broke the deadlock and helped the BJP candidate win by a draw of lots.'"

66,66,"b""Due to the BJP's deep traction among vast swathes of voter bases across the country for a decade, Rahul nearly doubling the tally of his party in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections must be counted as the coming of age of a leader whom many did not consider even a serious politician let alone a credible challenger to PM Modi.The Lok Sabha presented an unusual spectacle today: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a polite handshake following the election of NDA's candidate Om Birla as the Lok Sabha speaker. The two leaders accompanied Birla to the Speaker's chair. That's because Rahul Gandhi now holds a constitutional position which is opposite to PM Modi's. While PM Modi has been elected the leader of the house in the Lok Sabha, Rahul has become the leader of the opposition.\n\nThough Rahul has been seen as the main opponent of PM Modi for long, he was never acknowledged formally as the topmost leader of the opposition. The INDIA bloc of opposition parties led by the Congress did not choose its prime-ministerial candidate ostensibly due to the presence in the opposition bloc of more senior leaders than Rahul such as Sharad Pawar and Mamata Banerjee.\n\nBut now, since the Congress has emerged as the biggest opposition party by winning 99 seats, a big improvement over its 2019 tally of 52, the opposition has to accept Rahul as its tallest leader.\n\nA big landmark in Rahul's political journey\n\nThough Rahul entered politics in 2004 when he won for the first time from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, his real entry in active politics began in 2011 when he visited Bhatta-Parsaul villages in Jewar near Noida and undertook a foot march in the villages along the Yamuna Expressway in support of farmers who were agitating against the land acquisition plans of the Uttar Pradesh government under Mayawati.\n\nThat was Rahul's first political outing aimed at influencing the assembly elections the next year. However, Rahul's campaign in support of the agitating farmers failed to make a mark as the ruling BSP won the Jewar constituency seat in which the twin villages of Bhatta-Parsaul fall. Rahul had campaigned widely in the state and was expected to revive the flagging fortunes of the Congress party. But the Congress finished fourth with 28 seats, while the Samajwadi Party won the elections.\n\nEver since 2011, Rahul has struggled to make a mark in national politics. When he was projected for the first time as Modi's challenger in the 2014 elections, the Congress faced a humiliating defeat by winning just 44 seats. Though the tally rose to 52 in 2019 elections, it was generally believed that the Congress under Rahul was stuck in a low-performance mode. But now becoming the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha after leading the Congress to win 99 seats when his party had shrunk to just another opposition party, Rahul has achieved success finally.\n\nDue to the BJP's deep traction among vast swathes of voter bases across the country for a decade, Rahul nearly doubling the tally of his party in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections must be counted as the coming of age of a leader whom many did not consider even a serious politician let alone a credible challenger to PM Modi.\n\nNow with Rahul as the leader of opposition, the politics in India will be all about Modi versus Rahul.\n\nWhy Rahul as LoP matters\n\nThis is the first time in a decade that the Lok Sabha will have a leader of opposition. In the previous two Lok Sabha terms, Congress was the largest opposition party but failed to win the minimum number of seats required to have the post of the leader of opposition.\n\nThe LoP post not only signifies the status of a leader and party, but it also comes with several powers and privileges. Rahul will enjoy several privileges including the rank of a cabinet minister. He will play a key role in allotment of seats and rooms in the House, supply of official documents, constitution of parliamentary committees, and the daily business of the House.\n\nImportantly, he will be part of selection panels for heads of various bodies such as the CBI, Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Information Commission, the NHRC and the Election Commission.\n\nWhat matters more than the privileges is the salience Rahul will get in the national politics. His words will now carry more weight and impact. With Rahul getting this constitutional post, the debate over whether Rahul is the most deserving among the opposition leaders for the post of the prime minister has been settled once and for all. Since the leader of opposition is seen as the shadow prime minister, Rahul's claim to that post will now be even stronger.\n\nThe biggest difference will be the BJP will not be able to dismiss Rahul now as a non-serious politician.PM Modi and the BJP-led ruling NDA bloc must now expect a stronger opposition from Rahul who will keep the ruling party and the government always on their toes."""

He also said the weight of urea bags has been reduced to 45 kg from 50 kg earlier, effectively increasing costs for farmers.\n\nThe Congress MP also drew the attention of the government to high rate of unemployment.'"

He underscored that these organisations do not speak for the entire Hindu community, refuting their assertion of exclusive religious legitimacy.In a charged parliamentary session marked by fiery exchanges between the government and opposition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervened during Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s inaugural speech of the session.

This prompted Home Minister Amit Shah to demand an apology from Gandhi, accusing him of offending millions of Hindus.\n\nShah countered Gandhi\'s call for non-violence by referencing the Congress party\'s role in historical events such as the Emergency and the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, asserting that Gandhi has no moral ground to speak on peace and non-violence given the party\'s past actions.\n\n""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi.

80,80,"b'The highlight of the 18th Lok Sabha on Wednesday was the appointment of Speaker of the Lower House with Om Birla continuing the role, allowing Prime Minister Modi-led NDA government to win the first battle of numbers on the floor. Despite tough resistance from the INDIA bloc, the Opposition did not press for a division of votes - a candid admission of lack of numbers on their side.\n\nThe shocking results on June 4 led to speculations regarding a possible change in the power matrix in the Parliament due to the change in the number of seats that BJP and NDA hold. AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi reflected the opinion of many in the opposition camp when he said today that the ruling BJP will not be able to ""steamroll"" the opposition as the character of the House has changed in the new Lok Sabha.\n\nWith the BJP failing to secure a majority on its own, the number dynamics in the Lower House has indeed changed. Prime Minister Modi is now dependent on allies for his government\'s survival.\n\nHas the 18th Lok Sabha poll results led to any change in how the Parliament functions, well, the answer is both ""yes"" and ""no.""\n\nA look into changes in Modi government in the Parliament:\n\nOm Birla 2.0:\n\nThe first battle that the Modi government won was the appointment of speaker of its choice. The appointment of Om Birla as Speaker of Lok Sabha had the stamp of authority which was a trademark of both Modi 1.0 and Modi 2.0. With the firm support of allies, the government did not let opposition dictate terms on the Speaker\'s election and refused to enter into any negotiations over the choice of deputy speaker.\n\nThe opposition wanted the deputy speaker\'s post, but the government sent out a clear message to them. ""First, you support Speaker\'s election, and after that, we can discuss about the Deputy Speaker."" The stalemate ensured an election for Lok Sabha Speaker - something that had happened only three times till now - in 1952, 1967, and 1976.\n\nRahul Gandhi will not just be \'Shehzada\'\n\nThe biggest change in Parliament that will be for Prime Minister Modi will be his relation with Rahul Gandhi. In the last 10 years, PM Modi has referred to the Congress leader as Shehzada. However, the changed number dynamics have now made the former Congress chief an integral part of the government\'s functioning for the first time. We saw the first glimpse of this today when Rahul accompanied PM Modi to escort Om Birla to the Speaker\'s chair.\n\nRahul Gandhi is not just \'shehzada\' for PM Modi now as the Congress leader will be part of several parliamentary bodies and panels for key appointments that are headed by the Prime Minister. Rahul may still not have a say in their functioning, but he will be privy to all the discussions.\n\nEmergency to counter \'Save Consitution\' attack?\n\nThe BJP has been using the emergency of 1975 for the longest to attack Congress, but the new campaign by the ruling government by evoking the dark days ahead of the Parliament session is seen as a counter move to the INDIA bloc\'s ""Save Constitution"" campaign. With Speaker Om Birla joining the government in attacking Emergency, the opposition\'s hopes of any perceptible change in the government\'s functioning due to reduced numbers - may remain just that.\n\nIs the BJP still the boss?\n\nAs the BJP failed to cross the majority mark, the party had to rely on NDA allies to form the government at the centre. When PM Modi took oath for a record third term in office, the belief was that allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu\'s TDP and Nitish Kumar\'s JD(U) would walk away with plum portfolios in bargain for their crucial support to run Modi 3.0.\n\nThe BJP has not yielded too much space to allies and has kept almost all the important portfolios to itself. The big fours- Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman and Jaishankar were seen returning by holding their important ministries.\n\nModi 2.0=Modi 3.0?\n\nModi 3.0 has been marked by continuity, unlike Modi 2.0 when change was perhaps the only constant. Prime Minister Modi has retained most of his top ministers and even his top officers. He has also not changed the portfolios of key ministers. The choice of Speaker also signalled this spirit of continuity.\n\nThe continuity is in contrast to the second term when Prime Minister Modi returned to power with an overwhelming majority of 303 seats, and his Cabinet and council of ministers saw several changes. In 2019, the BJP selected Om Birla as Speaker replacing Sumitra Mahajan who presided over Lok Sabha during Modi 1.0.\n\nBalance on policy issues\n\nAnd while the BJP imprint has been strong till now, the saffron party will have to tread a cautious path when it will come to policies of Modi 3.0. Even before the countours of government was finalised, allies went public with their reservations on the Agniveer scheme, which was a flagship policy of Modi 2.0. The caste census is another issue on which the allies would have a different perspective. During campaigning, the BJP had teared into the Congress over reservations given to Muslims in Karnataka. However, in TDP, the BJP has an ally which openly supports the idea and is all set to implement it in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThe BJP is emphasizing continuity under Modi 3.0, akin to his previous terms, asserting stability and routine governance. The upcoming Budget might introduce incentives, additional grants, or potentially a special category status for Andhra Pradesh under Chandrababu Naidu and Bihar under Nitish Kumar. These concessions hold significant importance for Naidu and Nitish, potentially outweighing their leverage at the central level. By maintaining unity within the NDA, the BJP retains the ability to assert dominance over the opposition, reminiscent of its authority over the past decade.\n\n(with ToI inputs)'"

The passing of the three criminal law bills in Parliament last year sparked a series of debates regarding the need to take such steps towards evolution in the field of law with the introduction of new criminal laws.\n\nIn an interview with ANI, former Union Law Minister Ashwini Kumar and Congress leader said, ""The way the government rushed to bring these laws in Parliament and the way it implemented rushed to, is not desirable in a democracy. These laws were neither adequately discussed in the Parliament committee nor extensively discussed in the House, even no consultation held with the stakeholders.""\n\n""Now, the opposition parties demanding a change in the legal architecture of criminal laws should be preceded by meaningful deliberations between all the stakeholders that appears not to have been done. It is the only grievance of the opposition parties that should be addressed by the ruling party, said Senior Advocate Ashwini Kumar.""\n\nAdvocate Sumit Gehlot from Fidelegal Advocates and Solicitor also interacted with on this issue and said, ""In the New Criminal Laws, law enforcement agencies have been given unfettered powers without checks and balances and safeguards and safety provisions have been ignored, which will be prone to misuse. Under the New Criminal Laws, there will be potential violations of civil liberties.""\n\nHe further asserted, ""Like Sedition Law under Section 150 of BNS, the offence has been made Draconian. Section 150 will surely be challenged, as will other provisions, which will result in being struck down by constitutional courts. The insertion of the Sedition Law as a backdoor entry seems to be for political reasons. Why is terrorism inserted as a general penal law offence when it is already punishable under special legislation? Why has police custody been extended from 15 days to 90 days?\n\n""There are many regressive steps in the new criminal laws and all these will lead to instances of police torture and abuse and there are many grey areas. These additional powers and discretion with the investigating agency will be misused. There is a dilution of civil liberties and furthermore, there is insufficient institutional capacity to enforce these laws properly,"" he said.\n\n""Reforms were required in the existing criminal colonial laws through specific amendments and more deliberation with all stakeholders but not in this manner. Notably, these laws were passed arbitrarily, in haste, and without even proper debate in the Lower House and Upper House of Parliament,"" Advocate Gehlot added.\n\nIn this regard, Dr Adish C Aggarwala, Sr. Advocate & Chairman of All India Bar Association and outgoing President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said, ""Many colonial-era laws had been hanging around like an albatross around the neck of the Indian legal fraternity even 75 years after Independence. Now, the soul and spirit of the Bharat have been infused into the key criminal laws, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Sanhita, that are replacing the archaic and outdated Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the Evidence Act.""\n\n""The overhaul of these prime criminal laws was long overdue, as many of their provisions had outgrown their purposes and, in fact, were incongruent to the times and objectives for which they had been legislated. The new laws, with the soul and spirit of the new Bharat, therefore bring a sea-change in our criminal justice delivery system,"" said Aggarwala.\n\n""The implementation of provisions addressing current challenges, such as the classification of mob lynchings as a distinct crime, including hate crimes on the basis of race, caste or community, gender, language or place of origin, and implementing and supporting victims, will be indispensable. Providing police and judicial staff with sensitivity training would help ensure that these cases are handled impartially and with respect for the trauma of victims,"" said Dr Adish Aggarwala.\n\nFormer Union Law Secretary PK Malhotra, on this issue, said, ""The three new criminal laws, replacing British-era legislation, have led to petitions being filed in the courts questioning the legality of these laws and some state governments are reluctant to implement these laws. It need not be overemphasized that these three laws, i.e., the IPC, Cr.PC, & Evidence Act, were required to be reviewed keeping in view the changing social scenario and technological advancements.""\n\n""Since the subject falls under the concurrent list of the Constitution, Parliament is fully competent to enact these laws. If any State wants modifications in any of these statutes, the Legislature of the State can pass a modification law. However, it can be enforced if the changes made by the state legislature are approved by the president.""\n\n""It is said that the provisions of these three legislations are victim-centric and will lead to an expeditious trial. No doubt provisions like timelines for investigation, trial, delivery of judgement, use of technology in service of summons, trial of offence, virtual hearing, provision for zero FIR, and provisions of community service for minor offences are welcome steps. A section of society feels that certain provisions, like offences relating to terrorism, accident cases, marital offences, and increasing punishment for certain offences, like Section 377 of the IPC, need greater consultation and deliberation. In the absence of sufficient safeguards, the possibility of excessive use of authority by law enforcing agencies cannot be ruled out,"" he added.\n\n""The three laws were passed in a hurry and at a time when 25% of the members of Lok Sabha were suspended and had no opportunity to participate in the debate. More consultation with various stakeholders would have given the opportunity to the Government to rectify some of the deficiencies, which are now becoming a cause of concern. Be that as it may, the reality is these laws have been passed by Parliament and the date of their implementation has also been notified. The appropriate course will be to implement these laws and any deficiencies coming to the forefront can be rectified in due course by bringing necessary amending legislation,"" said former Union Law Secy PK Malhotra.\n\nFormer Additional Solicitor General (ASG) and Senior Advocate Pinki Anand said, ""Considering the gargantuan numbers that clog our system, I\'m sure the drafters of these Acts had their tasks cut out for them. The numbers necessitated a change. The courts had been trying to tackle this problem using their own powers of mandamus, whether by ensuring that bail matters are heard and listed daily or by setting up targets. Discourage pass-overs and adjournments. The present government has acted with great alacrity in providing what we can now call the Arbitration-isation of criminal justice. The provisions that have reformed our commercial adjudications in court, such as limits on adjournments, and time lines.""\n\n""This is an exercise of giving our criminal statute the thrust of democratic legitimacy. Previously, our criminal statutes drafted in 1860, 1872, and 1973 were products of their time. And to keep them relevant, it required an extensive exercise of judicial interpretation. This would require manifold PILs, Writs, etc. all the way up to the Supreme Court to keep our statutes relevant and achieve the twin purposes of ensuring due process for the accused and fulfilling our society\'s moral and legal duty to give justice to the victims of crime. Now, these judicial pronouncements weren\'t made strong by electoral legitimacy. The choice of the people to choose the laws that bind us together is a basic feature of a democratic social contract. The Parliament has reviewed the judgements of the past and the jurisprudence that emerged from our Hon\'ble Courts and has made democratic calls on what to keep, what to modify and what to remove. This was a democratic exercise that was needed. It\'s a revision that was needed. The rust that had settled has been cleansed,"" said Senior Advocate Pinki Anand.\n\nN. S. Nappinai, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court, also gave her opinion on the issue and said, ""The new criminal laws are here to stay and the sooner we adapt to it, the better. Resistance to change is natural but it can only be assuaged through transparency and effective implementation. For this reason, the shortening of the initial timeline proposed for implementation appears to be a bit of a hasty act. The changes to the procedural aspect in particular needed more time for effective adaptation. One can only hope that an escalated process has been adapted to bring the system to speed.""\n\n""There are many procedures that are a welcome addition. In particular the use of technology in the investigative process. Not addressing existing loopholes in the law be it on procedure or substantive law is an unfortunate miss. A lot more to ensure a safer India including in the cyber domain could have been achieved through effective additions in the new laws.\n\nRetention of a slightly modified version of proving electronic evidence is a grave error, which is despite explicit directions from the Supreme Court to the legislature to address,"" said Senior Advocate N. S. Napping.\n\nAdvocate Aishwarya Kaushiq, BTG Advaya said, ""Political parties and legal professionals are concerned about two issues: the procedural irregularities in passing the three bills in Parliament in December 2023 and their broad implications. The legal fraternity fears these changes could lead to increased litigation as existing cases may need re-evaluation under the new laws, adding to the judiciary\'s backlog.""\n\n""Recently, the Chief Justice of India pointed out that district courts often hesitate to grant bail, even for minor crimes. This puts more cases on the desks of the Supreme Court and High Courts, taking up valuable judicial time that could be used for public benefit. The new laws are designed to make it easier to address such issues, improve how investigations are done, strengthen victim rights, and make trials more efficient. At the same time, the new laws grant police broader arrest and detention powers, triggering fears of misuse and unjust arrests. Privacy concerns arise from laws enabling increased state surveillance,"" Advocate Aishwarya Kaushik added.\n\nOn June 26, the Bar Council of India (BCI) passed a resolution acknowledging numerous protests from bar associations and state bar councils nationwide against the newly introduced criminal laws. Relying on assurances from the Union Home Minister regarding potential amendments based on valid reasons and suggestions, the BCI has urged all bar associations to refrain from protests.\n\nThe BCI plans to engage in discussions with the Central Government to convey legal concerns and has requested bar associations and senior advocates to identify unconstitutional or harmful provisions for constructive dialogue.'"

He spoke to everyone irrespective of which divisions they come from.""\n\nKamlesh Singh, Central Treasurer of the Indian Railway Loco Runningmen Organisation (IRLRO), who was present during Gandhi\'s visit, said that loco pilots across all rail networks face similar challenges and have similar grievances.\n\n""Whether it is about long duty hours, denial of weekly rest or lack of washroom and lunch break, these are common issues that all train drivers face across the divisions and zones. So this doesn\'t merit an issue whether he met a loco pilot of Delhi Division or some other divisions,"" Singh said.\n\nIRLRO\'s Working President Sanjay Pandhi said that at all Running rooms of Indian Railways, only loco running staff from other stations rest.\n\n""An MP, who is also a leader of the opposition can meet anyone anywhere including all railway employees,"" Pandhi said.\n\nKumaresan clarified that Gandhi didn\'t enter the running room as this would have disturbed loco-pilots who were taking rest before their next shift.\n\nLoco pilots also said that the Railway Ministry sent its officials to meet and attend to the grievances of train drivers after the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi met them.\n\n""After Mr Gandhi left, officials of the Railway ministry visited us at the New Delhi Railway Station to attend to our grievances,"" Singh said.\n\nSingh added that it was the first time that any official from the Railway Board showed such a prompt response to their problems.\n\n""We shared the same issues with the official which we shared with Mr Gandhi. Long duty hours leading to work stress and no washroom and lunch break while being on train driving duty are some of our problems which we shared with Mr Gandhi and Railway Ministry\'s officials,"" Singh said.\n\nAccording to Kumaresan, the issues they shared with Mr Gandhi were already known to the Ministry as the loco associations have regularly written to it.'"

Venugopal said Gandhi would be ""a bold voice for the common people"" and ensure the government ""is held firmly accountable at all times"", he told reporters in a statement late Tuesday.\n\nGandhi\'s ascension is significantbecause, for the previous decade, his once-mighty Congress party did not have enough seats in the legislature to qualify him for the post.\n\n""It\'s a huge thing what he has achieved in this election -- he\'s been able to get the masses to take him seriously,"" Sugata Srinivasaraju, an author of a book on Gandhi, told AFP.\n\n""But is that sufficient to be a good leader of the opposition inside the parliament?

Jaishankar -- the defence, interior, transport, finance and foreign ministers, respectively -- staying on in their jobs.\n\nBut out of his 71-member government, 11 posts went to coalition allies who extracted them in exchange for their support -- including five in the top 30 cabinet posts.\n\nMany will also be eying the election of the speaker, a powerful post overseeing the running of the lower house, with lawmakers slated to vote on Wednesday.\n\nCoalition allies covet the post, but others suggest Modi will put forward a candidate from the BJP.\n\nFor the first time, lawmakers took the oath in India\'s new parliament building, a grand hexagonal legislature inaugurated last year.\n\nThe building was seen as the centrepiece of a remodelling of the heart of New Delhi by Modi aimed at ridding the Indian capital of the vestiges of British colonial rule.'"

109,109,"b'MUMBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi passed the first big political test of his third term on Wednesday as a ruling party candidate was elected speaker of the lower house of parliament, defeating an opposition lawmaker by a voice vote.\n\nOm Birla, from Modi\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who was speaker in the last term of the house, was elected again, beating K Suresh, an eight-time MP from the opposition Congress party.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi, who was declared the leader of the opposition late on Tuesday by his party, accompanied Modi as they congratulated Birla on his election, a rare show of harmony between the two bitter rivals.\n\nThis is the first time that Gandhi, 54, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, will assume a constitutional role in the parliament, a role that gives him the status of a cabinet minister.\n\n""It is very important that the voice of the opposition is allowed to be represented in this house,"" Gandhi said in his speech while congratulating Birla.\n\nThe speaker of the Lok Sabha, as the lower house is known, is usually a lawmaker from the biggest party and is usually elected unopposed, through a consensus between parties.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has 293 lawmakers in the lower house, 21 more than the required majority of 272.\n\nModi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a record-equalling third time on June 9, will need the support of regional parties to run his government in his third term, after his party lost its outright majority in parliament.\n\nThe speaker, who conducts business in the decision-making lower house and presides over it, is critical to the passage of laws.\n\nReporting by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan'"
110,110,"b'NEW DELHI, July 2 (Reuters) - Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi\'s first speech in the new parliament ran into controversy with parts of it, including accusations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, redacted on Tuesday for violating the rules of the legislature.\n\nThe decision by the speaker of the lower house came a day after Gandhi made his maiden speech as the leader of the opposition in the chambers, his first official position after two decades as a lawmaker representing the main opposition Congress party.\n\nAmong the sections removed from the speech, which was telecast live by TV channels, were Gandhi\'s attacks on Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and what he said were their links to religious hate and violence.\n\nGandhi also made multiple references to industrialists Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani and linked them to Modi and his government, which were removed by speaker Om Birla, parliament records showed.\n\nFollowing the speech, federal ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Kiren Rijiju told reporters that they met Birla to point out ""inaccuracies"" in Gandhi\'s speech and were assured their complaint would be examined.\n\nUnder Indian parliamentary rules, the speaker can expunge or redact words used by lawmakers in the chambers that are deemed defamatory, indecent, unparliamentary, or undignified, following which they cease to exist in parliament\'s records and can no longer be reported by the media.\n\nResponding to the speaker\'s decision, Gandhi said ""truth cannot be expunged"".\n\nHe wrote to Birla requesting the redacted remarks be restored, saying they were not violations and conveyed the ""ground reality"" and ""factual position"".\n\n""Taking off from records my considered remarks goes against the very tenets of parliamentary democracy,"" he said.\n\nThe scion of a dynasty that gave India three prime ministers, Gandhi is the first leader of the opposition in a decade in the lower house, where no opposition party was able to secure the numbers to claim the position in the last two terms.\n\nHe led an opposition alliance of two dozen parties that denied Modi an outright majority in the April to June multi-phase general election, forcing him to depend on regional parties for the first time and form a coalition government to return as prime minister for a rare third straight term.\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove the extraneous word \'challenged\' in paragraph 11)\n\nWriting by Sakshi Dayal; Editing by YP Rajesh and Alex Richardson'"

If they speak and raise voices, they have a life threat,"" Annamalai said.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu BJP executive committee meeting is still underway. The meeting, also attended by Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, assumes significance as it is the first major meeting of the party in the state after the Lok Sabha election results were declared on June 4.\n\nThe BJP\'s electoral performance in the state in the 2024 general election was lower than the party\'s expectations. Though the party could increase its vote share, it did not win any seats.\n\nIn the 2024 election, the BJP, by contesting in 23 Lok Sabha constituencies, secured nearly 11.1 per cent of the votes in the state, up from the 3.6 per cent it got in the 2019 general election.\n\nAIADMK, the principal opposition party in Tamil Nadu, was the BJP\'s ally, but just months into the election, the former snapped the alliance, accusing Annamalai of abusing the Dravidian political icons.\n\nThere were also reports of internal bickering in the state unit of the BJP, with some leaders blaming Annamalai for the results.\n\nMeanwhile, Union Minister and BJP leader L Murugan condemned the killing of Armstrong.\n\nHe said the DMK government has failed to maintain law and order in the state.\n\nIn a conversation with ANI, Murugan said, ""A National Party\'s state president was unable to survive because of the law and order situation in Tamil Nadu.

120,120,"b'Delhi Congress, led by Yadav, rejects an AAP alliance for polls, targeting BJP-AAP issues and local concerns like water shortage. Emphasizing grass-roots engagement and Rahul\'s vision, observer feedback will drive the July 15 executive meeting. Plans include 42 new observers, 280 blocks based on MCD wards, an auto-rickshaw campaign, and district president evaluations.Delhi Congress leaders, including district Congress presidents, voiced that the party should not go into any alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in future and fight the upcoming assembly polls on its own, sources said on Wednesday. Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav on Wednesday held a meeting with the district presidents and observers to review the feedback of monthly meetings of the blocks and districts level and to set the agenda for the upcoming assembly polls, a statement said.\n\nThe Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) fought the Lok Sabha elections in an alliance under the banner of INDIA bloc. However, the BJP swept all seven seats here.\n\n""All the district presidents and observers of the national capital were present in the meeting. We have to face the elections in the next six to seven months. We have received several feedbacks and when asked about the alliance, all voiced that the party should contest the upcoming polls on its own,"" sources said.\n\nIt was also decided that during the polls, the party should also focus on campaigning at block level. The block level issues should also be raised during the campaign apart from aggressively targeting the BJP and AAP governments, they said.\n\nYadav held the meeting with 14 district Congress committee presidents and 42 newly-appointed district observers and reviewed the feedback received from the 280 block and 14 district Congress committee meetings held on July 2 and 5.\n\nYadav has convened an executive committee meeting of the state Congress on July 15 to discuss the suggestions and observations that came up at the meeting to chart out the future plans of the Delhi Congress, it said.\n\n""The common refrain at the meeting was that the party need to mount aggressive campaigns against the BJP and the AAP governments and expose their lies, falsehood, inaction and incompetence in tackling the major issues affecting the people like water shortage, power crisis, waterlogging, pollution and corruption at all levels. One of the suggestions received at the meeting was to hold protests to highlight local issues, which will make a big impact among the local people towards the Congress,"" the statement said.\n\nHe said that the block and district Congress committee meetings would also give an opportunity to the party workers at the grass-root level to be heard and their suggestions taken into account, as the meetings should not be one-sided.\n\nYadav also said that the functioning of many block and district Congress committees were not very satisfactory and the party will take some strong steps to activate and strengthen them, and form a team of 10 workers each at the booth level to consolidate the party position.\n\nAt the outset, Yadav outlined the need for the block and district Congress committees to shore up their activities more aggressively by involving all sections of the society, particularly the young, as ""we need to involve young people to progress to fulfil the vision of party\'s senior leader Rahul Gandhi"".\n\nAll block presidents will mount the Congress slogan of ""Haath Badlega Ab Dilli Me Be Halath"" on 50 auto-rickshaws in their areas, he said.\n\n""The party will evaluate the performance of district presidents who have occupied in their positions for more than three years. Acting presidents will be appointed in blocks without heads so that no post is left vacant in our all out efforts to strengthen the party at the grass root level,"" Yadav said.\n\nIt was heartening to note that there was 100 per cent attendance of district observers in these meetings, he said.\n\nYadav also said the party will spare no effort in implementing the issues discussed at the block and district levels.\n\nThe format to divide 280 block Congress committees on the basis of MCD wards has been prepared, which will be spread over 68 assembly constituencies, while 4-4 blocks will be formed in New Delhi and Delhi Cantonment, and eventually the pradesh Congress committee will have 258 blocks.'"

""In the article, he has drawn attention towards current global activities related to security and their impact on India.""\n\nTrivedi highlighted the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a recent attempt on US presidential candidate Donald Trump\'s life as alarming examples of global political violence.\n\n""Such tendencies that provoke violence and murder are inspired by statements wherein political parties, for short-term political benefit, use words like \'violence\' and \'murder\'.

These leaders, now members of parliament, were from Congress,"" he said.\n\nReflecting on the history of violent rhetoric in Indian politics, Trivedi mentioned Sonia Gandhi\'s 2007 remark, \'Maut ke saudagar\' (merchants of death), and contrasted it with the BJP\'s restraint even during the Emergency period under the leadership of Indira Gandhi.\n\nHe stressed the long-standing threat such language poses to national security, citing the Ishrat Jahan case as a prime example of political manipulation.\n\nTrivedi also pointed out the lapses in security during the 2013 Patna rally, where serial blasts occurred while Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh, both under Z-plus security, were present. ""What security measures were taken by the central government?"" he questioned.\n\nHighlighting the current government\'s efforts, Trivedi noted the secure cover provided for Rahul Gandhi in Kashmir and Manipur.\n\n""Politics is in its place but the words used by Rahul Gandhi against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, such as \'hinsa hinsa hinsa\' (violence) and \'hatya hatya hatya\' (murder), should be put to a stop.""\n\nTrivedi concluded, ""The whole world is witnessing the repercussions of hate speeches, and such things in India can be very dangerous. Do not become arrogant. Be civil.""\n\nEnding the conference with a poignant quote, he said, ""Lagegi aag, to aayenge ghar kai. Zadd mai, yahaan pe sirf hamaara makaan thodi hai.""

The entire country is now telling him -- tumse na ho payega (you are not up to it).""\n\nIn another post in Hindi, Kharge said the PM called the Congress a ""parasite"" but on February 8, 2021, he used the same word in Parliament to refer to the farmers who feed the entire country.\n\n""You insulted the year-long struggle of the farmers for their rights. In front of that, your dictatorial government had to bow down and withdraw the three anti-farmer black laws.\n\n""Today you have used the same word for the Congress party. This is not an abuse for the Congress party. It is a matter of pride for us to sacrifice our lives for nation building along with the farmers,"" Kharge said.\n\nMany Congress leaders have made countless sacrifices for this country, he said.\n\n""Our leaders have built this country with their blood and sweat,"" Kharge added.\n\n""We are proud and honoured that our forces, displaying indomitable courage and valour, defeated Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971 and China in the Nathu La and Cho La wars in 1967,"" he said.\n\nHe hit out at Modi for making ""false and baseless"" allegations against the Congress of lowering the morale of the Army.\n\nThe Congress is and will remain with the farmers and soldiers of this country, Kharge said, adding that ""you cannot shake the strong legacy of this country with your dictatorship"".\n\nThe Congress has drafted the Constitution of the country along with highly respected great personalities including Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Sardar Patel, Kharge said.\n\n""To save the values of democracy in this country, the Congress Party is ready to face every abuse from the BJP. The decency of our leaders and their respect for the Constitution and institutions should not be construed as our weakness. The lesson of truth and non-violence shown by Gandhiji runs in our veins,"" Kharge said.'"

160,160,"b'New Delhi: Within three weeks of the Congress central leadership, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior leader Rahul Gandhi, directing the party leaders of poll-bound Haryana to put up a joint front and avoid airing differences in public, party circles now sense signs of sharpening factional fault-lines in the state Congress in the competitive rush by many state leaders to hold separate shows of strength in the form of their respective yatras. While these yatras, ahead of the September-October assembly elections in the state, are ostensibly to expose the so-called administrative failures of the 10-year BJP rule in the state, the Congress campers see in its plots closer home.\n\nThe latest to hit the yatra politics is Congress MP Deepender Hooda with his \'Haryana Mange Hisab\' yatra from July 15, which is expected to initially cover over a dozen assembly constituencies across nine districts with the plan to extend it to the rest of the state. His yatra also made the Congress circles both in Delhi and Haryana debate curiously whether it is designed to signal that the younger Hooda (46), is being handed over the faction\'s leadership mantle by his father, two-term CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda (76), ahead of the elections.\n\nGiven that Hooda Sr, leader of the Opposition in the assembly, controls the Haryana PCC leadership, the presence of state Congress president Uday Bhan to flag off Hooda Jr\'s yatra, thus giving it an official stamp, hardly surprised the party circles. But given that Hooda Jr is not heading the PCC or CLP or holding any senior AICC post -- he is a five-term MP and one of the invitees to the CWC -- and yet he is leading this yatra is being seen as part of an entitlement and a larger pre-poll projection at a time when there are many claimants to be the state Congress\' chief ministerial face. This factional positioning of leaders recently prompted the AICC to state that the Haryana Congress will fight the polls ""collectively"" rather than project a pre-poll CM face.\n\nMany Congress stake-holders also noticed that Hooda Jr\'s yatra commenced within days after AICC general secretary and former Haryana PCC president Kumari Selja, seen by many as the leader of the party faction opposed to the Hoodas, announced that she will lead a yatra across the urban belts of the state by this month-end against the BJP state government. This move came after Selja did a state-wide bus yatra last January, where another AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala and former CLP leader Kiran Chowdhury (now in BJP) joined her amid many projecting that yatra as a show of strength against the Hooda group.\n\nMany in the Congress also pointed out that while AICC general secretary in-charge Deepak Babaria had issued a public statement ahead of Selja\'s January yatra, asking the party workers to only participate in official functions.\n\nThese parallel yatra plots and the contributing growing factional tension in the Haryana Congress coincide with many in the party pitching for better and more effective AICC coordination with Haryana party leaders as party circles feel that the Congress in Haryana has a fighting chance to win the polls if the top state party leaders fight unitedly or can squander it if the high command fails to harmonise the faultlines.'"

The non-biological PM oversaw the destruction of India\'s manufacturing,"" he said.\n\nRamesh said the Congress has repeatedly warned ""the non-biological PM"" of these consequences.\n\n""Dr. Manmohan Singh took to Parliament to decry demonetisation as \'organised loot and legalised plunder\'. Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly drawn attention to the GST\'s devastation of job-creating MSMEs, pointing out that it was neither a Good nor a Simple Tax,"" he said.\n\nIn April 2020, after wide consultations with stakeholders, the Congress put out a five-point programme to revive the informal sector amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.\n\nRamesh pointed out that the party\'s Nyay Patra 2024 put forth strong proposals to revitalise the informal sector including establishing GST 2.0, with a single, moderate rate and relief for small taxpayers like MSMEs. The party also proposed to lessen the burden of tax on MSMEs owned by individuals and partnership firms, he said.\n\nThe Congress also sought to ensure a level-playing field and oppose the rampant monopolisation and oligopolisation that has crowded out MSMEs, Ramesh said.\n\nHe said that ""140 crore Indians are now paying the economic consequences of the non-biological Prime Minister\'s cronyism, arbitrary policymaking, and refusal to engage constructively on issues"".'"

Opposition lawmakers led by the Congress party\'s Rahul Gandhi held up copies of the constitution as they took their oath of office Monday.\n\n""Our message is going across, no power can touch the constitution of India,"" Gandhi told reporters.\n\nHere\'s a look at some of the BJP\'s domestic policies that may now be in doubt, or need to be reworked under a coalition government.\n\nUniform Civil Code\n\nFor years, the BJP has advocated for the replacement of India\'s religion-based laws with a uniform civil code. This would entail a non-religious set of rules governing issues like marriage, inheritance and divorce. Modi and his party have long championed for a uniform code. They see the current system as allowing non-Hindu communities -- especially Muslims -- to operate on their own terms, and a new code would likely outlaw many personal practices relating to marriage and divorce.\n\nIn a test case, BJP-run Uttarakhand passed the code in its state assembly earlier this year. Successive governments have stayed away from amending these laws out of fear of angering voters from all faiths. It\'s likely Modi\'s key regional allies -- all of whom have substantial Muslim populations in their states -- will shy away from siding with the BJP should they try and introduce the measure in the current parliament.\n\nNational Register of Citizens\n\nA month before India\'s elections kicked off in April, the government implemented a religious-based law -- the Citizenship (Amendment) Act -- which fast-tracks citizenship rights for immigrants from neighbouring nations except for those who identify as Muslim.\n\nThe law was seen as a precursor for a proposed national citizenship register, which will require Indians to prove their citizenship. Amit Shah, who retained his position as home minister in Modi\'s new cabinet, has previously promised to conduct a nationwide exercise to root out illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, many of whom are Muslims.\n\nIn a country with poor literacy and high poverty, documentation is often hard to procure for many Indians and consequently citizenship harder to prove. Critics had feared that if the BJP had won a large majority -- as many had predicted prior to the polls -- the government would\'ve likely pursued the national population register. However, a coalition government, in partnership with other state leaders, will likely force Modi to negotiate with his partners on any deal.\n\nMilitary Recruitment Scheme (Agnipath)\n\nIn 2022, the Modi government shifted the Indian army\'s recruitment policy to short-term jobs with no pension benefits. The announcement of the scheme resulted in protests across the country as it further limited employment options in a country already grappling with a severe jobs crisis. Under the plan, the recruits would train for six months, serve in the military for three and a half years but will not be entitled to pensions or other benefits when they leave.\n\nLeaders from two of the BJP\'s partners in Bihar -- which is also one of India\'s poorest -- have publicly asked for a review of the policy. During the election campaign, scrapping the scheme was one of the opposition\'s main promises.\n\nOne Nation One Election\n\nThe Modi government is keen to revamp the country\'s electoral system: It wants to hold simultaneous national and state elections. The government\'s stance is that concurrent elections would cut costs and improve efficiency. A committee constituted by the government on the subject submitted its report in March and recommended that the government move to enact a ""One Nation One Election"" strategy.\n\nAt the moment, state polls are spread across the country\'s five-year election cycle. For example, polls in the key states of Maharashtra and Haryana will take place later this year, just months after the country voted in national elections.\n\nTo implement the scheme, the government would need to amend the constitution, a task made considerably harder while governing with a coalition and against an opposition staunchly opposed to the proposal. Modi\'s opponents have long feared that the BJP will use its national popularity to also sweep simultaneously-held state elections. Currently, off-cycle elections spread over a five-year period mean local issues -- and parties -- often dominating voter\'s preferences.\n\nCensus and Delimitation\n\nIndia\'s last census was conducted in 2011. The next one, due in 2021, was put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, parliament passed a law requiring a census followed by a delimitation exercise, after 2026.\n\nThe last delimitation exercise, or redistricting, was conducted in 2002, with subsequent governments kicking the can down the road to not upset the current balance of seats in parliament.\n\nSouthern states, which have always lagged in terms of seat distribution -- given their lower population -- expect delimitation to further reduce their representation in India\'s lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. The country\'s populous northern states -- many of them BJP strongholds -- would almost certainly see their share of parliamentarians increase.\n\nA fresh census and reshaping of the political constituencies will also pave way for Modi to implement the women reservation bill that sees a third of lawmakers\' seats reserved for females.\n\nAffirmative Action\n\nUnder India\'s constitution, affirmative action is enshrined for socially and economically backward communities -- including of lower caste Indians. A specific quota of government jobs and places in government-run educational institutions are reserved for those on the lowest rungs of the caste system under the policy.\n\nModi\'s BJP lost support among lower caste Hindus in the latest election, with many of them voting for caste-based parties, especially in some key northern states.\n\nIn TV interviews and election rallies, Modi blamed the opposition for exploiting cleavages over the caste system to sway voters and repeatedly assured the country that the BJP would not scrap affirmative action policies. He also stressed that the BJP would never give affirmative action based on religion, specifically for Muslims.\n\nModi\'s ally, the Telugu Desam Party does target some affirmative action program on the basis of religion where it rules in Andhra Pradesh -- making it an issue where the BJP will likely be at odds with a much-needed ally.'"

Modi said: ""This is a very grave matter. To call the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter."" Gandhi turned it around and said, ""No, no, no. Narendra Modi is not the entire Hindu community. BJP is not the entire Hindu community. RSS is not the entire Hindu community.""\n\nModi\'s second intervention -that the Constitution had taught him to ""respect the post of the Leader of the Opposition, which is held today by Gandhi"" - drew jeers from the Opposition benches.

Gandhi was among the MPs who added ""Jai Samvidhan"" to their oaths last month. ""It feels nice... BJP people are repeating \'Jai Samvidhan\' after me,"" he quipped.\n\nEven Gandhi\'s stance while speaking was pointed out. Environment minister Bhupendra Yadav took out the rulebook and cited Rules 349 (12) and 352 (2) and said Gandhi was disrespecting the Speaker. Yadav said: ""Leader of Opposition is addressing the House for the first time. I would like to point out two rules - Rule 349 (12) and 352. First of all, LoP should know how to speak in the House. 349 (12) specifies the Speaker shall not sit or stand with back towards the chair. He is constantly speaking with his back towards the chair. Rule 352 (2) says \'make personal reference by way of making an allegation imputing a motive or questioning a bonafide\'. He has not only levied an allegation against the entire government but the entire Hindu community.""\n\nShah said, ""You cannot hide such a big issue by creating ruckus in the House. LoP has said that whoever calls themselves Hindu they are violent. I want to repeat his sentence - those who call themselves Hindus, they talk of violence and are violent. In this country, probably he doesn\'t know crores of people identify themselves as Hindus with pride. Do they all talk of violence? He should apologise for linking a particular religion to violence.""\n\nIn another instance, Gandhi claimed that Agniveers were not getting the compensation of \xe2\x82\xb91 crore as announced by the government. Once again Shah interjected and said: ""He should put forward the facts and if these are not facts, he should apologise to Agniveers and the entire nation."" Gandhi was unfazed and said that he had put forth the truth of Agniveers on the floor of the House and the families knew the truth. ""It doesn\'t make a difference what I say or you say."" To this, Rijiju appealed to the Speaker to intervene: ""How can he take it so lightly?""\n\nGandhi claimed that the Agnipath scheme had been introduced without proper discussion. Rajnath Singh got up and intervened: ""Please don\'t mislead the House. This scheme was introduced after a lot of discussion - it was discussed with 158 organisations. Such a scheme is there in the US, UK and other countries. Nobody has any problem. Making these statements without understanding is highly irresponsible. I would request you Speaker Sir to please expunge these remarks.""\n\nGandhi continued, ""It does not matter, you like Agniveer. We don\'t like Agniveer scheme. Once our government comes, we will stop it. We don\'t want it.""'"

190,190,"b'New Delhi: The Congress and its government in Karnataka find themselves in a quandary over the now ""temporarily"" halted proposed law framed to ensure quota for locals in private sector jobs. According to some party leaders, if the bill was born out of the political compulsions of the Karnataka Congress and its government to fulfill their electoral promises, its halting in the wake of the protests from industry demonstrated the government\'s administrative compulsions to be sensitive to the backslash from business and investors to the proposals and avert a capital flight from Bengaluru.\n\nCongress leaders pointed out that the party\'s election manifesto in the run-up to the state assembly election had promised such a quota in the private sector. ""There is a growing sense of disenchantment among the local Kannadiga population that their youths are not finding enough jobs, even as industry, business and investments are growing in Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka with active support of the state government,"" said a senior Karnataka Congress leader who did not wish to be identified. ""Some studies claim the local population does not have even a 20% share in these jobs. The Congress has, therefore, made promises, especially to the locals in the C and D categories in the private sector. There seems to be some confusion, especially after the talk of quota in managerial jobs. That will have to be sorted out."" The state cabinet\'s quota push, incidentally, came after the Karnataka Congress\' below par performance in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nAfter the flip-flop on the issue, the task for the state government, according to some Congress functionaries, is to find ways to remain engaged with the stakeholders, including business representatives, even while managing the political task of not facing the charge of going back under pressure or burying a pre-poll promise.\n\nAs the development also led to murmurs on whether the CMO had made the required wider consultations among cabinet ministers and party functionaries for a consensus, and whether it was ready with a blue-print on its implications on, and possible responses from, the business and investment community, AICC functionaries also said that the CMO\'s clarification on halting the move came after a nudge from the Congress high command, especially after the backlash from the industry.\n\nNonetheless, the Rahul Gandhi-powered Congress establishment has been high on quota politics of late, and was fully on board not only with the Karnataka Congress\' pre-poll proposal but also with the Telangana Congress promise for quota in private sector both in education and employment.\n\n""Now the cabinet will have to find a way to tackle the issue. There is a proposal that it could constitute a committee of ministers and representatives of the industry and investment community to study the bill and the way ahead,"" said an AICC functionary'"

In this matter, the tribals also passed a political resolution on July 18 at Mangarh Dham in Banswara, Rajasthan.\n\nWhat is the demand?\n\nThe tribals have several demands that include the formation of a separate Bhil Pradesh by combining 49 districts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Along with this, they are demanding that the fifth schedule be implemented in the tribal area. Apart from this, there is a demand to give reservations to the tribals in proportion to the population, mention tribal religion separately in the census column, name 80 per cent of the land of Beneshwar Dham in the name of tribals, give the rights of land property of the concerned areas to the tribals, and ban gold mining in Banswara.\n\nAdditionally, the tribal organisations of western Madhya Pradesh have been demanding a separate Bhil state for 12 years. The only MLA of the Bharat Adivasi Party from Sailana of Ratlam district, Kamleshwar Dodiyar, has also raised this issue in the assembly. The government replied in the House that any proposal for the creation of any new state is always passed in Parliament and not the Assembly.\n\nThe focus areas\n\nThe 3 crore tribals demanding ""Bhil Pradesh"" live in about 49 districts of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Their number is about 21 per cent in Madhya Pradesh, 14.8 per cent in Gujarat, 13.48 per cent in Rajasthan and 9.35 per cent in Maharashtra. Their number in the country is more than 11 crores.\n\nThe tribals are spread in 25 states and 5 union territories, including the Northeast, but as per some reports, 4.4 per cent of the tribals in the country come from the Bhil tribe and its sub-tribes.\n\nA long-pending demand\n\nIt may be noted that the demand for a separate Bhil state has been raised in the past in the name of ""Bhilistan"", ""Bhilkhand"" and ""Jhabukhand"". Previously, in the demand for a separate Bhil state 39 districts (16 districts of Gujarat, 10 districts of Rajasthan, 7 districts of Madhya Pradesh and 6 districts of Maharashtra) were included which covered 90 assembly and 11 Lok Sabha constituencies. Now the new proposed Bhil state will include 130 assembly and 20 Lok Sabha constituencies. The demand gained momentum after the creation of a separate state of Telangana in 2014.\n\nWhich districts of these 4 states have been included?\n\nRajasthan: Banswara, Dungarpur, Barmer, Jalore, Sirohi, Udaipur, Jhalawar, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Kota, Baran, and Pali.\n\nGujarat: Aravalli, Mahisagar, Dahod, Panchmahal, Surat, Vadodara, Tapi, Navsari, Chhota Udaipur, Narmada, Sabarkantha, Banaskantha, Bharuch, and Valsad.\n\nMadhya Pradesh: Indore, Guna, Shivpuri, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Dhar, Dewas, Khandwa, Khargone, Burhanpur, Barwani, and Alirajpur.\n\nMaharashtra: Nashik, Thane, Jalgaon, Dhule, Palghar, and Nandurbar.\n\nThe movement for a separate Bhil state is strongest in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Rajasthan, BTP and, currently, the Bharat Adivasi Party are leading it. In Gujarat, BTP MLA Chhotu Bhai Vasava is leading it. However, the Rajasthan government has made its stand clear on the demand for Bhil Pradesh from the tribal family. Tribal Development Minister Babulal Kharari has said, ""A state cannot be formed on the basis of caste. The state government will not send any proposal to the Centre in this regard.""\n\nDemand for Bhilistan was first raised in the 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a demand to create Bhilistan by combining tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat along with tribal areas of the Udaipur division of Rajasthan. The Tribals say that till now, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress (Congress) governments have been in power in all three states but as the demand for a separate state was limited to one area thus it was not given due importance. Despite this, from time to time, the demand for Bhilistan has been raised by tribal organisations in this matter. Now as the political scenario has changed in some areas of North Gujarat and Western Madhya Pradesh, including Southern Rajasthan, the demand for Bhil Pradesh instead of Bhilistan is gaining momentum again.\n\nHow is a new state formed?\n\nUnder Article 3 of the Constitution, the Central Government has the right to form a separate state. It can increase or decrease the area of any state. It can change the boundaries. It can also change the name of the state.\n\nTo form a new state, the state assembly first passes the proposal for the formation of a new state. Then it is sent to the President. The Centre can take action on this. Usually, such proposals are sent to the Home Ministry by the President, and the Home Minister then presents a proposal for the formation of a new state in Parliament. It also decides how many districts, assemblies, and Lok Sabha seats will be there in the new state.'"

216,216,"b'BENGALURU: Union heavy industries and steel minister HD Kumaraswamy on Saturday claimed that the alleged Mysore Development Authority (Muda) site scam involving chief minister Siddaramaiah\'s wife Parvathi has the potential to become a larger scandal than currently perceived. He raised questions about whether Siddaramaiah had declared the land in his affidavit filed for the 2013 assembly elections.\n\n""It is a much bigger scam. Siddaramaiah is claiming that the 3.16 acres in question, acquired by Muda, was gifted to his wife by her brother in 2005. If that is the case, had he declared this asset in his affidavit filed for the 2013 polls? It needs to be investigated when the land title was transferred to the name of Siddaramiah\'s wife and whom it originally belonged to,"" Kumaraswamy said on the sidelines of the party\'s core committee meeting here.\n\nThe allegations by Kumaraswamy are expected to increase pressure on Siddaramaiah. According to the Representation of People\'s Act, the affidavit of a candidate contesting an assembly or parliamentary election should list the family assets and liabilities. Under the act, filing false information in an electoral affidavit is liable to be punished with the rejection of the nomination.\n\nKumaraswamy detailed that the land was originally owned by Jawara alias Ninga, notified for acquisition in 1992, and subsequently denotified in 1997-98. He indicated that Parvathi\'s brother, Mallikarjuna, purchased it in 2004 before transferring it to her through a gift deed in 2005. He stressed the need for a thorough investigation into the transactions during this period.\n\n""This Muda scam has been discussed since last year, and I have all the documents related to it. The documents are being distributed on the streets like the pen drives were in Hassan during the Lok Sabha polls. I need not do anything since senior Congress leaders, who are behind this, themselves will take it forward,"" Kumaraswamy added, without naming deputy CM DK Shivakumar.\n\nHe accused urban development minister Byrathi Suresh of visiting Mysuru to whisk away documents related to the scam to Bengaluru via a special helicopter. Kumaraswamy asserted that Siddaramaiah would not escape accountability in the Muda scam, unlike the Arkavathy Layout case, which was hushed up in 2017.\n\nUnion minister Pralhad Joshi on Saturday demanded an impartial investigation into the Muda scam and appealed to the state govt to transfer it to CBI.\n\n""Siddaramaiah should hold Ahinda convention in Hubbali only after coming out clean in the Muda scandal,"" Joshi said. He said the transfer of DC Dr K V Rajendra has proved the scam.\n\nMeanwhile, H A Venkatesh| Senior Congress functionary, said: ""It is not true that Javara, an SC member, was the landowner. CM Siddaramaiah\'s wife Parvathi owned 3.16 acres in Kesare, Mysuru. This land was used by Muda for layout development without acquiring it.

238,238,"b'After a month of intense speculation that there could be a change of leadership in Karnataka, the Congress high command seems to have put a stop to it, at least for the time being. The conjecture was fuelled by party legislators from the camps of both Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy Chief Minister and party chief D.K. Shivakumar. It reached a tipping point when a seer asked Mr. Siddaramaiah to vacate the seat in favour of his deputy, at a State government event.\n\nAn examination of the last three and a half decades of Karnataka politics shows that speculation over leadership change and even changes within short spans are not new. The ninth Assembly elected in 1989 saw three Chief Ministers during one tenure for the first time in the State. Since then, there have been 18 Chief Ministers in Karnataka. These include short tenures for the Bharatiya Janata Party\'s B.S. Yediyurappa (four times) and the Janata Dal (Secular)\'s H.D. Kumaraswamy (twice). Over this period of 35 years, President\'s Rule was imposed thrice in the State. The average tenure of a Chief Minister during this period was less than two years. Three coalition governments with the JD(S) were pulled down. The BJP came to power twice (in 2008 and 2019) lacking a simple majority and eventually cobbling together a majority through engineered defections, in an exercise called Operation Kamala. During 2008-2013, there were three Chief Ministers and during 2019-2013, there were two. The exceptions to this rule were the S.M. Krishna (1999-2004) and Siddaramaiah (2013-2018)-led Congress governments.\n\nThis means that the the State\'s political circles have generally been abuzz with rumours about leadership change. In such scenarios, Chief Ministers have always been putting out political fires and, in some cases, skewing policy to placate dissenting MLAs by earmarking more funds to certain constituencies and districts. The top agenda in such situations has always been to manage the party high command, factionalism within the party, and defectors or alliance partners in case of a coalition government. All this naturally leaves the administration with little time and energy to focus on policy and governance.\n\nH.D. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Yediyurappa came to power in 2006 in a coalition government with an arrangement that each of them will be Chief Minister for 20 months. Mr. Kumaraswamy was sworn in first. Senior bureaucrats recall that the decision of the coalition created multiple power centres and leaders within the government, and chaos in the administration.\n\nMr. Yediyurappa, who came to power in 2019 after toppling the JD(S)-Congress coalition government by engineering defections, resigned on July 26, 2022. He announced his decision to step down at an event to commemorate two years of his government. Mr. Yediyurappa was dogged by speculation of leadership change through his two-year tenure. During that time, a top bureaucrat had told The Hindu that constant talk of change of guard can undermine the full authority of the chief ministerial position.\n\nIn a similar vein, former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, who had a short tenure of less than a year in 2012-13, recently advised the Congress to desist from speculating about the issue in public. ""It is the party\'s internal matter regarding whether or not they want to change the Chief Minister. But discussing it day in and day out in public will have an adverse effect on the administration,"" he said. Union Minister Pralhad Joshi also rued that these discussions had ""brought the administration to a standstill"". He asked, ""If members of the government themselves are discussing leadership change every day, why will the bureaucracy and administration be serious about this government?""\n\nWith the Congress winning 135 seats in a 224-seat Assembly in 2023, the present dispensation was expected to be a ""stable government"". However, the Opposition has been repeatedly saying that the government ""could fall any day"". The supporters of the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister have been trying to undermine each other, with one faction arguing for leadership change and the other denying it. Even if there is an arrangement on power-sharing between Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar, it is not in the public domain. However, constant talk on the issue has given the people of the State a sense of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu, despite the present government\'s stability in terms of numbers.\n\nRead Comments'"

312,312,"b'SRINAGAR: In a growing trend over the past decade, Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing a proliferation of ""political start-ups"" in the Valley but these outfits have failed to make a significant impact during elections, politicians and analysts said on Sunday. The decades-long unrest in Kashmir has witnessed the rise of several political parties and fronts, including the Jammu and Kashmir Nationalist People\'s Front, Bharat Jodo Yatra, JK Peoples Movement, Jammu and Kashmir All Alliance Democratic Party, Jammu and Kashmir Workers Party, Jammu and Kashmir Peace Party and the Awami Awaaz Party.\n\nMany of these have either refrained from contesting elections or have faced defeat in the recently held Lok Sabha polls.\n\nVeteran politician and CPI(M) leader Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami said the leaders of these political start-ups often begin with a bang, enjoy patronage like security and other things, and then disappear like ""lost planets when elections are held"".\n\nInstead of floating political start-ups, ""we should concentrate on strengthening democratic institutions in the entire Jammu and Kashmir,"" he asserted.\n\nEchoing similar views, PDP leader Waheed Para said these start-ups have a ""negative impact"" on the democratic space and highlighted their lack of popular support and legitimacy.\n\nPara said these political start-ups only demolish and discredit the democratic space. ""The recent Lok Sabha election has shown them the mirror clearly,"" he added.\n\nIn a veiled reference to businessman-turned-politician Altaf Bukhari\'s JK Apni Party and the veteran politician Ghulam Nabi Azad-led DPAP, Para said almost three parties were created by breaking up the PDP which only led to demolishing the democratic space in Kashmir and discrediting those left behind.\n\n""Results reflect that only people should be given the right to choose and elect. Parties created in hybrid form don\'t enjoy the popular support or legitimacy,"" he added.\n\nNoted Kashmiri Pandit leader and lawyer Titoo Ganjoo said the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 saw the emergence of top-down political start-ups in Jammu and Kashmir that lack organic growth and fail to resonate with the local populace.\n\n""These new entities were predominantly composed of disenchanted politicians engaging in exploratory efforts, ultimately doomed to fail in gaining significant political traction,"" he said, adding that these start-ups never pose a challenge to the established political order.\n\nThe leadership of these political start-ups, conceived to be driven by some government agencies, failed to reflect the genuine aspirations of the local populace, Ganjoo added.\n\nThese leaders exhibit a significant disconnect from the region\'s realities, focusing more on reclaiming their political relevance rather than addressing the core issues faced by the people, according to prominent social activist Firdous.\n\nGanjoo argued that the behaviour and conduct of these leaders highlight their opportunistic tendencies and lack of substantial commitment to the region\'s long-term stability and development.\n\n""Their efforts were perceived as superficial and self-serving, failing to foster genuine political engagement or meaningful change,"" he said, adding that the lack of inspirational leadership and substantive direction has left the region in a state of disillusionment with no coherent or compelling vision for the future emerging from these political start-ups.\n\nDr Touseef Bhatt, a socio-environmental activist, said that despite representing a new wave of political innovation in a conflict-ridden region, political start-ups in Kashmir face challenges in making a meaningful impact due to their limited experience and resources.\n\nTheir dependence on external funding raises concerns about their autonomy and long-term sustainability in a volatile political environment, he said.\n\nWhile these start-ups aim to engage young Kashmiris in the political process and address local concerns, questions remain about their potential influence on the existing political dynamics and the peace process in the region.\n\nAs Kashmir grapples with ongoing challenges and aspirations for change, the fate of political start-ups in the region remains uncertain, raising questions about their ability to effect meaningful political change.'"

The loco pilots drive trains over long distances, far from home, and are often pressed into duty without adequate breaks, the sources said.\n\nThis causes great stress and lapses in concentration which is a major cause of accidents, they added.\n\nThis has been acknowledged by the Indian Railways in multiple reports, including the recent probe in the accident in Vishakapatnam, they further said.\n\nThe loco pilots demand a weekly rest of 46 hours, which means a train driver returning home on Friday afternoon will return to duty no later than Sunday morning.\n\nThe Railways Act 1989 and other rules already provide for 30+16 hours of rest per week, which is not being implemented, the sources alleged, adding that aeroplane pilots also typically get this much rest.\n\nAccording to the party, the loco pilots demanded that two consecutive nights of duty should be followed by one night of rest, and trains should have basic amenities for drivers.\n\nThe lack of rest is caused by understaffing due to the government halting recruitment of loco pilots, the party sources claimed.\n\n""Over the past four years, the Railways Recruitment Board has not recruited even a single loco pilot despite tens of thousands of vacancies,"" a party source claimed.\n\nGandhi assured the loco pilots that he has been consistently raising the issue of ""railways\' privatisation and lack of recruitment"", the sources said, adding that the Congress leader listened to their concerns and supported their demand for adequate rest.\n\nGandhi expressed hope that this would significantly reduce accidents.\n\nAs LoP, he promised to take up their demands with the government, the sources said.\n\nSince Gandhi undertook the over 4,000 km Kanyakumari to Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, he has held several interactions with a cross-section of society from mechanics to farmers and labourers.\n\nGandhi had met labourers here on Thursday and asserted that providing full rights and respect to those involved in manual labour is the mission of his life.

For us, there is more than power, there is truth. For you (the BJP), there is only power, that is the only place you want to be... When we fought the BJP, we were not violent,"" Rahul said while drawing a parallel between the abhaya mudra and the hand symbol of the Congress.\n\nHowever, this was not the first time that Gandhi mentioned the ""abhaya mudra"" and drew a parallel with his party symbol and showed images of gods across religions to make his point.\n\nIn January 2017, Gandhi spoke about finding the party\'s symbol in the images of Lord Shiva, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Buddha, Lord Mahavira and Hazrat Ali. He made the statement while addressing a ""Jan Vedna Sammelan"" or ""People\'s Plight Convention"", organised by the Congress.\n\n""I was looking up the meaning of the Congress hand symbol. I saw the Congress party\'s symbol in Shiv ji\'s portrait. Then, I saw other photos. I saw Guru Nanak ji\'s photo, there was the Congress\'s sign. I saw Mahaveer ji, Buddha, Bhadrakaal... all had the Congress symbol... The symbol denotes that we should not get scared, be deterred by present circumstances. I looked at Congress policies. I saw Gandhiji\'s and Nehruji\'s correspondence too. They spoke about not being afraid of the British,"" Gandhi said while addressing the convention.\n\nThe BJP had then approached the Election Commission accusing Gandhi of dragging religion into a political matter.\n\nAgain during the Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, he repeated the idea on several occasions.\n\nSpeaking in Kurukshetra, Haryana, in January 2023 as part of the yatra, he said: ""What does this symbol (palm) stand for? You have seen it in Lord Shiva\'s photo. You may say it is aashirvad (blessing). No. This is abhaya mudra. This is the symbol of tapasya (penance). Do one\'s job, tapasya, and don\'t be scared. This is why it is the Congress\'s symbol. You will see the same symbol in Guru Nanak\'s photo, in Buddha\'s and Mahavir\'s... The freedom movement was a fight of tapasya but those people (the RSS) did the puja of the British.""\n\nWhat is ""abhaya mudra""?\n\nIt is a gesture of fearlessness and protection, and is prevalent in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain iconography. This mudra, or hand gesture, is typically depicted with the right hand raised to shoulder height, palm facing outward, and fingers upright. Meanwhile, the left hand rests in the lap or performs another gesture. Associated with protection, this gesture is said to convey a sense of fearlessness, signifying the dispelling of fear and providing reassurance.\n\n&nbsp;'"

""This time, the opposition represents significantly more voice of the Indian people,"" he said, expressing hope that the house will function well.\n\nAmong the key issues the opposition plans to raise during the first session of the newly elected parliament are railway safety following a recent deadly incident, alleged irregularities in the central examination that left millions of young people aspiring to college studies in uncertainly, high inflation, and a lack of employment opportunities in the country, which currently has world\'s highest pace of economic growth.\n\nDays after the recent vote concluded, Gandhi also demanded a parliamentary investigation into a stock market crash after the election results were declared, claiming that Modi gave ""misleading"" investment advice. Around $380 billion in Indian stock market value was erased after the election, owing to the BJP\'s poorer-than-expected showing.\n\nGandhi is descended from Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and is the son of Rajiv Gandhi, another former prime minister who was assassinated in 1991. His mother, Sonia Gandhi, is a former president of the Congress Party.\n\nIn 2022, Gandhi launched the \'Bharat Jodo Yatra\' (Unite India March), which spans over 4,000km from Kanyakumari on India\'s southernmost tip to the northernmost Jammu and Kashmir in 150 days. In the aftermath of the political pilgrimage, the party won crucial elections in the states of Karnataka and Telangana.\n\nAhead of this year\'s general election, Gandhi launched another march from Manipur in the northeast to Maharashtra in the west. According to the party\'s leadership, the movement sought to ""prioritize the pursuit of social, economic, and political justice for the nation\'s citizens.""'"

Photograph: Sansad TV/ANI Photo\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was at his trenchant best -- or worst -- in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, when he taunted Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, in response to the latter's first speech to remember in his long stint as MP. (Come on, go back and recall which of Gandhi's speeches in Parliament comes to mind. Any? None?)\n\nThat's the point. Modi and the BJP may have derived peculiar satisfaction in excoriating Gandhi specifically and his party generally, but truth be told, Gandhi had hardly done anything of note in Parliament.\n\nTill Monday, when in a white T-shirt that showed off his biceps to good effect, he made probably the longest, and most hard-hitting speech of his life, from across the aisle to the prime minister and the rest of the Treasury benches.\n\nSuch behaviour, we knew, will not go unresponded, and it did not.\n\nModi began in what seemed to be a conciliatory note, listing out his government's various achievements, before shifting gears and going on overdrive against Gandhi.\n\nHe even appealed -- but more in the nature of an order -- to Speaker Om Birla, who seemed to be enjoying Modi's barbs, to take action over what he said was a conspiracy to derail parliamentary democracy.\n\nDon't be surprised if the headlines tell us that such action has indeed been taken.\n\nSo, between the red and blue corners, who has come off best?\n\nThat depends on who you ask.\n\nA neutral observer would say, going by the short first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, get ready for more skirmishes between the Treasury benches and Opposition.\n\nNeither side is going to yield, and what will be affected is the House's business.\n\nConducting the House's business is the government's remit; disrupting it is the Opposition's intent.\n\nUnless, of course, saner counsel prevails, but there is no such entity in sight now.\n\nThe current impasse is inevitable, for it springs from the BJP's, no, Modi's electoral reverse, when he failed to lead his party over the majority mark. Leave aside the 400-seat target he set, he couldn't even manage to cross the party's 2019 seat count.\n\nHe may have formed the government with the help of allies, but it is a vastly diminished government and a vastly diminished Modi.\n\nHe may not have admitted to it; but it is there to see, in the retention of most of the seniors in familiar jobs, extensions to key officials, etc, the most critical of which was the Lok Sabha Speaker. Continuity, they call it, but it is more like ringfencing the government from any sudden impulse from within rocking the boat.\n\nThis retains the loyalists, but does nothing to silence the enemy forces baying outside the castle walls.\n\nIMAGE: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi speaks in the House, July 1, 2024.

Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nIndian Muslims were among those greatly relieved with the Bharatiya Janata Party with Narendra Modi at its helm, not securing again a clear majority of its own. But will the fact that Modi is no longer a 'lord' onto himself, and is instead dependent on coalition partners with potential to be exacting at times, make India a communally less-polarised nation?\n\nWill Muslims be able to once again lead a more zestful life, no longer having to constantly look over their shoulders to check if a marauder's arm or a lynch brigade was reaching out for them?\n\nQuestions arise because within days of the election results, several incidents across several states, notably Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Telangana made it clear that although the verdict may have been reassuring there was little change in people's actions.\n\nThese episodes of targeted attacks on Muslims established that for a section of people and, sadly, even officials of the State, the election results conveyed no lessons.\n\nThe script was eerily familiar in Chhattisgarh, where a mob of cow vigilantes detained a truck within Raipur district in which three Muslims men were transporting buffalos from Uttar Pradesh to adjoining Odisha.\n\nThe crowd took law into their hands and in the violence perpetrated on the alleged cattle-smugglers, all the three men died.\n\nIn MP's Mandla district, the state government performed the role of the mob and dished out bulldozer justice to eleven Muslim families by demolishing their homes.\n\nBrazening it out, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, obviously exuberant after the BJP swept all 29 seats in the state in the Lok Sabha polls, decided to observe this year as Gauvansh Raksha Varsh (bovine protection year).\n\nThe houses which were demolished had been allegedly built on government land. But, the reason cited for sending the bulldozers to raze the houses was the allegation that these families were key players in the illegal beef trade in the state.\n\nThe state government alleged that following a tip off, they discovered beef in the refrigerators in these eleven houses and thereafter decided to demolish the houses.\n\nTellingly, the local superintendent of police stated that the meat seized from these houses, was found to be beef by the local government veterinarian.\n\nHowever, it is well known that often buffalo meat, whose trade and consumption is permitted, is often mistakenly assumed to be cow meat.\n\nIMAGE: A Muslim woman leaves a polling station during the seventh and last phase of India's general election in Varanasi, June 1, 2024. Photograph: Priyanshu Singh/Reuters\n\nIn September 2015, in the first such publicised incident after Modi became PM, in Dadri in UP, Mohammed Akhlaq was lynched to death on suspicion of storing beef in his house, although a forensic test later established that it was not cow meat.\n\nIt is necessary to recall the Dadri incident because the political response to it was contrasting.\n\nWhile Modi, back from the United States after his maiden visit as PM, remained silent, several Opposition leaders including Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal condemned the incident and went to commiserate with the family.\n\nThe issue also figured significantly in the Bihar assembly elections with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and its allies, including the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal-United and the Congress, raked up this matter to garner the secular anti-BJP vote.\n\nIn contrast, now, almost the entire Opposition remained silent not just on the recent Chhattisgarh and MP incidents, but on the others too.\n\nQuite clearly, the Opposition parties are diffident about speaking out when 'politics of hate' manifests itself.\n\nIMAGE: Muslim women arrive at a polling station to vote during the second phase of the general election in Mathura, April 26, 2024. Photograph: Anushree Fadnavis/Reuters\n\nDoes this mean that attacks on Muslims by vigilante groups and even government forces merely on suspicion is the new normal?\n\nDoes the passive response of Opposition parties demonstrate that these parties do not have the political courage to articulate concerns of the Muslims and even the Christians, because it fears backlash from Hindus?\n\nIt is well known that even the Congress was cautious in fielding and deploying its Muslim leaders in elections from the first general elections onwards.\n\nBut in recent decades there has been significant fall in number of Muslim candidates fielded not just by the Congress, but even other non-BJP parties.\n\nThe guilt for shrinking Muslim presence in Parliament is not solely that of the BJP and its coalition partners.\n\nAt 78, the total number of Muslim candidates in the fray this time is an all-time low -- significantly lower than 320 in 2014.\n\nThe total number of 26 Muslim Lok Sabha members, this was the same number in the 17th House, is way below their proportion in population.\n\nImportantly, even parties which avowedly pursue secular politics and are active in states with significant Muslims presence, like the Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress, significantly reduced the number of their Muslim candidates.\n\nVery significantly in the Moradabad Lok Sabha seat, the SP did not field its sitting Muslim MP and instead put up a Hindu upper caste woman.\n\nDespite the fact that the constituency has more than 45% Muslim voters, the SP candidate defeated the BJP nominee.\n\nWith an eye on the Muslim vote the Bahujan Samaj Party put up a Muslim candidate, but he polled only slightly more than 90,000 votes, in contrast to the SP nominee's vote share of 637,000.\n\nQuite clearly, the Muslim voters cast their lot tactically and backed candidates with the best chance to worst the BJP nominee.\n\nIt is evident that the community has not turned against opposition parties for selecting fewer Muslim candidates.\n\nBut, choosing to remain silent when Muslims are attacked by lynch-armies backed by the BJP and its affiliates, with tacit support of the government, will be little but self-defeating politics.\n\nWhile it will be premature for non-BJP parties to begin fielding Muslims with gusto, but it is time to intervene in debates whenever violent incidents occur, and when the State plays a partisan role, as it did in Mandla and Ratlam where in a separate episode the homes of four Muslims were demolished by the state administration after charging them with throwing bovine remains inside a temple.\n\nIMAGE: Muslim women wait to vote at a polling station during the seventh and last phase of India's general election in Varanasi, June 1, 2024. Photograph: Priyanshu Singh/Reuters\n\nMarginalising communal politics and ensuring that Muslims live with dignity will be a long haul and Opposition parties cannot baulk from the pursuit of secular politics due to fear of antagonising the majority community.\n\nAs Verdict '24 has demonstrated, there are regions in India where people are beginning to withdraw support to communal and divisive politics.\n\nIn the course of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi evolved a radical vocabulary of secularism and found support for this among people besides securing backing of some opposition parties.\n\nHis coinage of running shops of mohabbat (love and affection) in the market of nafrat (hatred) must not remain just that.\n\nInstead, the sense articulated through the slogans has to become second nature.\n\nThe Opposition must gain courage and believe that advocating for peaceful coexistence among various religious communities is the original credo of India.\n\nIn the same vein, it must argue that the Hindutva worldview of unitarist cultural nationalism was rejected by people for decades after Independence.\n\nDivisive politics based on hate and prejudice gained support only through the decades-long Ram temple agitation. But, as some sections of Indians made it obvious in the elections, there are limits to such politics.\n\nOpposition parties must not be hesitant in speaking out whenever the mob with tacit State support targets Muslims.\n\nIt must be communicated to people that no Indian Muslim should be made to feel that their ancestors took a wrong decision during Partition to remain in the nation of their birth where religion was not the basis of nationalism.\n\nNilanjan Mukhopadhyay is an author and journalist based in Delhi-NCR.

Fielding of good candidates for the seats also played a big role in the party\'s victory, she added.\n\nThe Congress won the Dehra assembly seat for the first time on Saturday with its candidate Kamlesh Thakur, the wife of Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, defeating BJP candidate Hoshiyar Singh by a margin of 9,399 votes.

The BJP fielded all the three former MLAs from their respective seats.\n\nThe Congress fielded Kamlesh Thakur from Dehra, repeated its candidate Pushpinder Verma from Hamirpur and gave ticket to five-time Indian National Trade Union Congress president, Himachal Pradesh unit, Hardeep Singh Bawa, from Nalagarh.'"
326,326,"b'Hundreds of Indians die during winters when temperatures drop across Northern India affecting those who live out in the streets without adequate clothing. According to the 2022 report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on ""Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India,"", 720 people died of the cold during that year. The report also said an average of 810 deaths took place every year due to cold exposure between 2013 and 2022.\n\nAddressing a public rally at the Red Fort in December 2022, during the Delhi leg of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, the Nehru-Gandhi scion even talked about the media asking him about his choice of clothes, and if he didn\'t feel the cold. ""Why don\'t they ask (the same question) the farmers, labourers and poor children of India?""\n\nOn his 54th birthday last month, he once again addressed the question about the white t-shirts, which he continues to wear. ""I am often asked why I always wear a \'white T-shirt\' - this T-shirt symbolises transparency, solidity and simplicity for me,"" he said in a post on X as he launched a white t-shirt campaign.\n\nA changed wardrobe\n\nAs a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, Gandhi has long been in the public eye, with his political journey being scrutinised by supporters and critics alike. However, in the landscape of Indian politics, few leaders have experienced as great a change in public perception as Rahul Gandhi. The recent Lok Sabha elections have marked a significant phase in his political career, with a remarkable departure from his public image of a \'pappu\' to \'daddy\' (as netizens call him) -- thanks in large part to his changed wardrobe, image consultants believe.\n\nAccording to personal branding coach Taraa Vermaa Senguptaa, Gandhi seemed to be competing with other politicians but now he is doing it like himself. ""His simple t-shirt and cargo pants have been in direct contrast to the rest of the political class. Not to mention the unkempt, free-flowing beard during the Yatra,"" says Senguptaa.\n\nPolitical leaders often wear white kurta-pyjama (including Gandhi himself in the past) but according to Senguptaa, Gandhi\'s decision to veer away from this aesthetic seemed to be deliberate. ""The starched white unblemished kurta pyjamas have always signified the class divide between the rich and the poor. Gandhi\'s choice to wear the same white t-shirt day in and day out with the same cargo pants depicts a sort of camaraderie with the people. First impressions start with visual impact. And Rahul Gandhi\'s choice of attire created the impact of a common man, one of the people,"" she adds.\n\nIt\'s the same with the cargo pants Rahul Gandhi wears, which also have ""working-class origins"", even though they may now be a part of the hip cultural aesthetic and are being worn for fashion and not utility, says Senguptaa. She also noted they serve a dual purpose -- familiarising the Congress leader with both the working class and the youth of this country.\n\nThe Congress leader\'s decision also mirrors that of Mahatma Gandhi, who also forsook his British coat and pants for a Khadi dhoti and shawl because of the perceived injustices across the country.\n\n""I realised the substratum of truth behind the remark. I had my vest, cap and full dhoti on. When these uttered only partial truth, the millions of compulsorily naked men, save for their langoti four inches wide and nearly as many feet long, gave through their limbs the naked truth. What effective answer could I give them, if it was not to divest myself of every inch of clothing I decently could and thus to a still greater extent bring my\xc2\xadself in line with ill-clad masses?"" R K Prabhu\'s This was Bapu, a compilation of writings and speeches by Mahatma Gandhi, reads.\n\nMahatma Gandhi wrote this particular piece in September of 1921 when he decided to forego his Englishmen-like clothes.\n\n\'Solidarity with the common people\'\n\nSenguptaa also points out that Rahul Gandhi\'s choice of t-shirt and cargo pants seem similarly deliberate because of their utilitarian origins. So does Professor Satya Suman, School of Fashion, World University of Design, Sonipat. ""By wearing plain white T-shirts during his Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi projected an image of simplicity and solidarity with the common people, highlighting socio-political issues and reinforcing his message of unity and change,"" says Suman.\n\nSuman adds that after World War II, Hollywood icons such as Marlon Brando and James Dean popularised the military wear t-shirt as casual outerwear, transforming it into a symbol of youthful rebellion. It served as an accessible platform for protest fashion during the civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and other activism, adds Suman.\n\nImage consultant and coach Suman Agarwal also agrees. ""His wardrobe screams \'main alag hoon\' (I\'m different from the others) and I\'m one of you. Not to mention it also helps him connect with the youth of the country.""\n\nMentioning her daughter, Agarwal says the youngsters, who now see Rahul in a different light without any context of his image before, are electrified to know a leader ""who dresses and talks like them."" ""People treat you the way they see you. How you dress affects the way you think, feel and behave and, in turn, affects how people react and respond to you,"" says Agarwal, adding this has played a major role in Gandhi\'s image renewal.\n\n""His communication has become extremely candid. If you\'re not talking about your competition, it reflects confidence,"" Agarwal adds. Senguptaa agrees. ""He chose to walk, not to ride in a motorcade. He chose to talk to the people and not at them.""\n\n""I haven\'t always followed politics as much but people around me, my friends, and mutuals on socials (people who you become friends with online) have all been talking about this revival Rahul Gandhi has had and just shown up with such daddy energy and how. I have been seeing that viral \'Daddy\'s home\' edit everywhere,"" says Divyanshi Bareja, a 25-year-old from Bengaluru.\n\nExperts say the Lok Sabha elections 2024 have shown a more resilient Rahul, adding the real test will be in sustaining this momentum and overcoming the deeply entrenched scepticism about his leadership qualities. As Indian politics continues to evolve, Rahul Gandhi\'s ability to navigate these changes and further solidify his leadership role will be crucial for his political future and that of the Congress party, they believe.'"
327,327,"b'This was not the case with the Congress-led UPA after its 10-year stint in power (2004-14). This time the Congress was lucky that the rise in its vote share translated into more seats, nearly doubling its number from 52 to 99.\n\nBut the story goes beyond the data - and the situation has changed broadly in three ways.\n\nFirst, Gandhi has taken on the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) post and opted to lead the Congress from the front -- unlike after earlier results. For 41 months, till Mallikarjun Kharge took over as the party chief in 2022, there was no full-time president of India\'s Grand Old Party. It seemed to be waiting for Gandhi to make up his mind. After he stepped down as party president following the Congress\'s 2019 debacle, Sonia Gandhi stepped into the breach as interim president. But behind the scenes, Rahul Gandhi continued to take all the major decisions.\n\nToday, as LoP, he will deal with the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on committees to select the Central Vigilance Commissioner and the CBI Director, for example, apart from engaging with the government on a host of issues. He will also need to plan the nuts and bolts of the Congress\'s strategy in Parliament, ensuring that complaints against him about inaccessibility are not repeated, opening his doors to not just party colleagues but also leaders of INDIA parties.\n\nThe LoP post comes with other perks that will boost Gandhi\'s stature, including Cabinet rank and meetings with heads of states visiting India.\n\nGandhi is also the face of a more robust Opposition in Parliament, as was visible in the short Session that just ended, with its MPs enjoying the new space that has opened up for them given the BJP\'s shrunken numbers. As Gandhi spoke for more than an hour in the Lok Sabha attacking the government, the BJP protested but both the party MPs and PM Modi heard him out.\n\nThe recent release of INDIA partner and JMM leader Hemant Soren on bail, and Friday\'s news of interim bail to Kejriwal in the Enforcement Directorate case will further embolden the Opposition ranks.\n\nHowever, another change that was hoped for, of a return to ""normal"" politics, has been belied - at least in the recent Parliament Session. As the Opposition targeted it, the BJP\'s aggressive pushback conveyed that its new status of a party heading a coalition rather than a full-majority government would not mean any dilution in its take-no-prisoners approach.\n\nAt the same time, the BJP has shown a softer touch in handling its NDA partners TDP and the JD(U), which are crucial to the survival of the Modi government.\n\nThe third facet of the new Gandhi is his visibility on the ground, in some way an extension of his Bharat Jodo Yatra. Since the results came, he has paid visits to Gujarat (after some Congress workers were injured in a clash with the BJP), Manipur (to meet victims of the internal conflict in the state), Hathras (to meet victims of the recent stampede), Assam (to meet victims of recent floods), and Rae Bareli (his constituency, where he also visited the family of an Army officer who died in Siachen); he has met railway loco pilots to talk about their working conditions, after a recent accident in which one among them was blamed; and he was seen lending a hand to labourers at a construction site in Delhi.\n\nGandhi has clearly come a long way from the retiring young man who had to be pulled by veteran Congress leader Ambika Soni to the front row on the dais at a Congress meeting in 2003. In 2013, he was seen to have reluctantly agreed to become the party vice-president, though his acceptance speech speaking about the ghosts he had to exorcise, having seen his grandmother killed by the same security guards who had taught him badminton, had many Congress leaders in tears.\n\nRahul Gandhi\'s challenges?\n\nHe could get carried away by this initial euphoria, over-interpreting the 2024 mandate, which was a complex one. With no overarching Modi wave subsuming local factors, the latter played out differently in different states, unlike what had happened in 2014 and 2019.\n\nGandhi has shown a few signs of this oversimplification - such as equating the defeat of the BJP candidate in the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat (that covers Ayodhya) with the Opposition\'s defeat of the Ram temple movement. It would be reading wrong the anger among locals over the takeover of their lands and houses in Ayodhya. Similarly, the fatigue with Hindu-Muslim talk and its cynical use for political purposes can\'t be seen as a negation of people\'s consciousness of their Hindu identity, nor can it be ignored that they are happy over the construction of the Ram Temple if not its use as a poll issue.\n\nIt is early days yet to know how far Gandhi can take his continuing attempts to fashion a pro-Hindu ideological alternative to the BJP\'s Hindutva - arguing that ""Hinduism"" is different from ""Hindutva"", and is not the monopoly of Modi, the BJP or the RSS.\n\nBut the bigger challenge for Gandhi will be how to move forward in building the Congress as a national alternative to the Modi-led NDA, with signs now that the party has re-found support. Will the Congress move incrementally, carefully, wisely, in step with its INDIA allies, to prepare for the next battles in states, leading up to finally 2029? Or will it be tempted to focus solely on the party, given the window of opportunity that has come its way?\n\nMany of the Congress\'s regional allies have grown at its expense, and they will be particularly apprehensive about its moves. One of the first problems the Congress could face is from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, unless it can come to a clear understanding with allies Samajwadi Party and RJD that they will have the lion\'s share of the seats in the two states respectively for the Assembly elections (UP, 2027; Bihar, 2025).\n\nThe hope is that, having been at the receiving end of a powerful BJP, the INDIA partners may just hang together. And that Gandhi may well and truly own up to the role of Leader of the entire Opposition, and take everyone along - which will start with becoming a 24X7 politician.'"
328,328,"b'Sudha, 46, hails from Gummidipoondi village in Thiruvallur district, where girls being married off at 15 or 16 years was a common practice.\n\n""Good education is all that my mother could afford for me when my father died of cardiac arrest at a young age. I thought of how my education could help people,"" she says.\n\nShe chose to become a lawyer, going on to file two PILs which made an impact on public policy.\n\nIn 2021, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sudha approached the Madras High Court to seek the release of dry ration for children in government schools who were dependent on the mid-day meal programme.\n\n""I am someone who had mid-day meals in my school while growing up. I was pleased when a Division Bench ordered for the release of dry rations for students who depended on school meals each day,"" Sudha says.\n\nSubsequently, in the same year, she moved the high court to seek the installation of sanitary napkin vending machines in schools for girl students. The court directed some schools to install the machines, she says.\n\nSudha is the first person from her family to have become an MP. Her journey to the Lok Sabha was, however, not easy. She rose through the Congress\'s ranks, first with the Youth Congress during her student days at Tamil Nadu Dr BR Ambedkar Law College in Chennai. She later went on to become the chief of the women\'s wing of the state party unit.\n\nContesting as the Congress candidate in the recent Lok Sabha polls from the Mayiladuthurai seat, which was won by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the 2019 polls, Sudha was up against the candidates of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), and Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK).\n\n""During the campaign, other political parties pointed out that I was a non-local in my constituency. But I just went about meeting, greeting and hugging as many people in my constituency as possible,"" she says.\n\nHer campaign style -- waving at people instead of the ceremonial vanakkam -- also won her many admirers.\n\n""I hugged and kissed women from different castes. This posed a direct challenge to the caste system that promotes untouchability,"" she says.\n\nSudha polled 5.18 lakh votes, defeating the AIADMK\'s P Babu with a margin of 2.71 lakh votes.\n\nShe says senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra -- she was one among the few Congress leaders who walked with Gandhi all the way from Kanyakumari to Kashmir -- gave impetus to her political approach and campaign.\n\n""I saw that Rahul Gandhi waved at people and hugged them, striking an emotional chord with everyone around him. I replicated that in my campaign,"" she says. ""Even if I attempt a vanakkam, they wave back at me and hug me,"" she says with a laugh.\n\nRecalling the time she entered the Lok Sabha for the first time to take oath as a newly-elected MP, Sudha says she remembered social reformer Periyar, poet Subramania Bharati and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn that first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, she wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, asking how some people can film in Parliament when photography and videography are barred in it. A Congress MP was suspended for taking videos in the previous Rajya Sabha.'"
329,329,"b""In an interview, Mahara discusses the latest wins, what went wrong during the Lok Sabha polls, and the party's revival nationally. Excerpts:\n\nDo the bypoll victories signify the Congress's revival in the state?\n\nEven before this by-election success, the party's revival was evident nationwide. The Bharat Jodo Yatra added a sense of seriousness to our efforts and Rahul Gandhi ji's interactions with farmers, women, unemployed youth, and labourers helped us connect deeply with people. We are seeing the positive outcomes of these efforts. Rahul ji's performance as the de facto leader of the Opposition has also brought significant improvement. The false narrative of 'BJP versus who?' has dissipated. People now see Rahul Gandhi as the future Prime Minister.\n\nCould the party have performed better in the Lok Sabha polls?\n\nIn the Lok Sabha elections, we made mistakes in at least 20-25 seats nationally, including all five seats in Uttarakhand. Some Congress leaders who refused to contest these seats may have failed to gauge the public sentiment against the ruling party. Our bypoll victory within two months shows that people were dissatisfied with the BJP. However, candidate selection is crucial and my choices were not optimal. I believe if the Lok Sabha polls had been held in a later phase in the state, and with better candidates, we could have won at least three to four seats. Other than Ganesh Godiyal in Pauri, we should have gone with different candidates for the other constituencies.\n\nWas the Agnipath scheme an issue in the parliamentary elections?\n\nThe Agnipath scheme has had some impact but its effects will become more pronounced in the coming days. People need time to understand such changes and shift their mindsets. Many now feel they have been deceived. Villagers in Uttarakhand are realising that in future there will be no Subedarni, Lance Naik ki patni, or Captain sahab ki wife, reflecting a sense of loss of status.\n\nThe BJP is known for its ground strength. Do you plan to build something similar in the state?\n\nUnder the direction of our central leadership, I have been working on this for the past two years. I am transforming our party from being leader-based to cadre-based. We want followers of ideologies rather than leaders. Our ideology is our leader and this is what we are promoting on the ground. I have decentralised all meetings. Instead of bringing party members to Dehradun for every meeting, protest or event, we are organising smaller events at the district, booth, and block levels every few days. We can already see the positive results of these efforts.\n\nWas there a lack of coordination and communication among state leaders?\n\nI don't believe there was a lack of coordination and communication; rather, candidate selection played a big role in our Lok Sabha defeat. Another major issue was the lack of resources. We didn't have enough funds for posters, banners or meetings, because our bank accounts were seized. Campaigning in the hills presents unique challenges and the lack of funds exacerbated these difficulties. We could not compete with the BJP in this regard.\n\nSeveral key state leaders left to join the BJP before the elections. What are your plans to stop such an exodus?\n\nI believe those who wanted to leave have already done so. When the party lost both the 2017 and 2022 Lok Sabha elections, those lacking commitment could not maintain their resolve and abandoned their ideology. I prefer not to comment on those who compromise on their beliefs. However, people made it clear in this bypoll that they do not support turncoats.\n\nSenior leader P L Punia is coming to assess the results ...\n\nP L Punia plans to dedicate three hours to each of the five Lok Sabha constituencies. He will meet all our candidates for the Lok Sabha polls and the 2022 Assembly elections, as well as AICC and PCC members and other senior leaders. He will evaluate various issues, including lack of funds, and intra-party coordination. and candidate selection. Afterwards, he will share his findings with the top leadership.\n\nThe Congress has opposed the construction of a Kedarnath temple in Delhi. What is your take?\n\nWe believe there are already Panch Kedar (five Kedar temples) in the country and there shouldn't be a sixth one. Kedarnath is the oldest jyotirlinga and our Puranas specifically state its location. The BJP's attempt to establish a new Kedarnath temple in Delhi alters this tradition. While we have no objection to a temple to Kedar Bhagwan, the BJP is misrepresenting it as Kedarnath Dham, suggesting that visiting the Delhi temple will bring you the same blessings. To protest against the BJP's perceived disrespect of Baba Kedar, I am organising a 'Jai Gange Jai Kedar, Kedarnath Dham Pratishtha Raksha Yatra' on July 24."""

""Welfare programmes introduced by YSR during his rule are the inspiration for the \'six guarantees\' announced by Congress in the recently held Assembly elections,"" he said.\n\n""I remember YSR\'s statement after coming to power for the second consecutive time in 2009 that Rahul Gandhi will become Prime Minister of India. YSR left us before Rahul could ascend to the post. All Congress workers should strive hard to make him the Prime Minister,"" he said.\n\nYSR served as the chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh between 2004 and 2009. Three months after returning to power, he died in a chopper crash in September 2009.\n\nReddy said that YSR\'s padayatra, which helped bring Congress to power in Andhra Pradesh, also influenced Rahul to embark on his Bharat Jodo Yatra.\n\n""Rahul Gandhi is already working hard as the leader of the opposition. He is just one step away from assuming the PM post. The country will develop only under his leadership,"" he said.\n\nUrging Congress workers to take an oath to make Rahul the PM, he said, ""Posts and positions are not important for Rahul Gandhi. He could have become the PM anytime between 2004 and 2014. True supporters of YSR are those who work hard to make Rahul the next Prime Minister... I appeal to all YSR fans to join the Congress.""\n\nLast year too, the Telangana Congress, before storming to power in November, had celebrated YSR\'s birth anniversary - ostensibly an effort to woo YSR supporters from other parties, especially the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS).'"
331,331,"b'The decision was taken at a meeting of floor leaders of INDIA parties.\n\nConfirming the same, party general secretary KC Venugopal said Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi has written to Pro tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab informing that Rahul Gandhi will be Leader of Opposition in the lower house.\n\nEarlier this month, the Congress Working Committee had unanimously requested Rahul to take up the post of the LoP in the Lok Sabha, following which he said he would consider the proposal and take a decision soon.\n\nThe CWC had also adopted a resolution praising the role of Rahul in the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections. ""Shri Rahul Gandhi campaign was single-minded, sharp and pointed and more than any other individual it was he who made the protection of our republic\'s Constitution the central issue in the 2024 elections,"" the resolution stated.\n\nIt cited the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra as the reasons for singling out Rahul Gandhi.'"
332,332,"b'""The Chair only gives ruling / directives. The member whose name is called gets to speak in the House. The mic is controlled as per the directives of the Chair. The person sitting in the Chair does not have a remote control or a switch for the microphones,"" he said.\n\nPointing out that members of all political parties have representation on the panel of chairpersons who preside over the proceedings in the absence of the Speaker, Birla said: ""At least those who occupy the Chair should not raise such objections.""\n\nWho administers the mics in Parliament?\n\nA manual put out by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in May 2014 says that each MP is provided an individual microphone and a switch set at their specific desks, with each of these desks numbered based on the designated seat numbers of members. Each switch board contains switches in different colours. A grey switch can be pressed for a request to speak. The microphones on the desks, with an LED, light up red when the mic is activated.\n\nSo, when a member wants to speak, the manual notes, they have to raise their hand to indicate the same to the Speaker, while pressing the grey button. The mic is ""activated from the control room only when the member has been permitted by the Speaker to speak"", the manual notes.\n\nThis is indicated in two ways: with the LED ring going red and the LED on top of the microphone also going red.\n\nWhere does the current controversy stem from?\n\nIs it the first time the Congress has alleged that mics of its members in the House were switched off?\n\nDuring the course of his Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, Rahul Gandhi asserted several times that he was compelled to hit the streets as the government was ""choking"" the voice of the Opposition by not even letting elected members speak in Parliament.\n\nIn February 2023, after Rahul gave a 52-minute-long speech in the Lok Sabha, Birla, who was the Speaker in the previous Parliament as well, noted this, saying: ""We should refrain (now) from commenting outside the House that the Speaker switches off the microphone.""\n\nRahul responded, saying: ""But Speaker Sir, it\'s a reality that you switch off the microphone.""\n\nA month later, in March 2023, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the then Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, wrote to Birla saying that his microphone had been muted for three days. ""I am deeply disheartened to observe that ever since the House resumed after the break on March 13, 2023, there has been a government-sponsored disruption in the House. It appears to me that there is a well-hatched conspiracy on the part of the party in power to tarnish the image of an individual member of an Opposition Party (Sh Rahul Gandhi),"" he said.\n\nDays later, on March 17, the Congress alleged that microphones of the House were muted for 20 minutes. Sharing a video on its official Twitter account, the Congress wrote: ""Earlier the mike used to be off, today the proceedings of the House have been muted. The house is mute for PM Modi\'s \'friend\'."" The Opposition was at the time demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee report into the Adani Group in light of the Hindenburg report on the business group\'s financial dealings.\n\nIn the 21 minutes that the House functioned that day, there was no audio link for all but 1.20 minutes. The Lok Sabha Secretariat said this was due to a ""technical glitch"" at the official broadcaster\'s end, but the Congress said it was another move to ""silence voices in Parliament"".\n\nAround this time, speaking at an event at the British House of Parliament, Rahul talked of Opposition leaders back home being ""silenced"" to stop them from speaking. The BJP criticised him for making such statements while abroad.\n\nHas the row been confined to the Lok Sabha?\n\nDuring the passage of the three farm Bills (later withdrawn) in September 2020, the audio feed of Rajya Sabha TV was disrupted briefly. The Central Public Works Department, which maintains the Parliament Building, had blamed it on the damage caused to microphones at the Chairman\'s seat by some MPs who were protesting over the Bills.\n\nThe legislation had been later passed amidst a bedlam.\n\nIn July 2023, during the Monsoon Session of Parliament, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed he was ""insulted"" after his mic was turned off while he was speaking in the House. ""It was a breach of my privilege... My self-respect has been challenged. If the House is run on the instructions of the government, I understand that it is not a democracy,"" Kharge said, with Opposition MPs supporting him.\n\nLater, Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar attacked Rahul over his comments, saying ""shutting off the Opposition"" was a thing done during the ""black chapter of the Emergency"". ""It is not possible now.""\n\nDoes a breach of privilege claim hold?\n\nThe powers, privileges and immunities of either House of Parliament and of its Members and committees are laid down in Article 105 of the Constitution. Article 194 deals with the powers, privileges and immunities of the State Legislatures, their Members and their committees.\n\nWhile the Constitution has accorded special privileges and powers to parliamentarians and legislators so as ""to maintain the dignity and authority of the Houses"", these powers and privileges are not codified. Thus, there are no clear, notified rules to decide what constitutes a breach of privilege, and the punishment it attracts.\n\nIt is a breach of privilege and contempt of the House to make speeches or to print or publish libel reflecting on the character or proceedings of the House, or its Committees, or on any member of the House for or relating to his character or conduct as a legislator.'"
333,333,"b'He says he does not remember the last time he had breakfast because it has become a routine for him. He has learned that customers choosing long rides could be found near railway stations and bus stands between 6 and 8 am. These long rides are crucial as they cover long distances. After this, he often gets office-bound customers until 11 am. If he gets a ride to the airport, half a day is over by the time he returns which is why he does not prefer airport rides anymore.\n\nA BCom graduate, Mazhar spends at least 12 hours a day behind the wheel. ""Around 15 to 16 rides a day is good. I try to come home for lunch but driving a cab is not financially viable anymore. I am unable to spend enough time at home, too. If I save Rs 2,000 a day after the app\'s commission, I can take home only about Rs 800 after expenses on food, fuel, maintenance, etc. This is despite having my own car,"" laments Mazhar.\n\nAfter working as a driver in Saudi Arabia for two years, Mazhar returned to Hyderabad in 2016, hearing about the arrival of app-based platforms. ""I used to drive for an IT company\'s contractor before I went to Saudi. However, when I heard from my friends that app-based platforms were doing well in Hyderabad, especially due to an influx of the IT population, I decided to return. Those were good days when daily earnings and incentives were good,"" he adds.\n\nHis main concern now, however, is the lack of a transparent grievance mechanism, which, he says, is often tilted in favour of the customer and leads to the driver losing access to their accounts. The driver, he adds, is most often blamed when a customer raises a complaint and gets no fair hearing.\n\n""Forget about social security, insurance, or other benefits; even if a customer misbehaves, the driver has no means to raise the matter with the company. While dealing with a drunk customer, or a customer who does not understand any common languages, or someone who is not happy with the air-conditioning or the fare, the blame always falls on the driver,"" adds Mazhar, calling for government oversight into issues concerning gig and platform workers.\n\nA driver is registered on three or four apps, while a customer is also signed into several. ""If all these apps are on one platform created and monitored by the government, many of the issues concerning drivers as well as customers would be better addressed,"" he says.\n\nThe Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) has been demanding the same. During their initial meeting with Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy after the Congress formed the government last December, he promised to develop a mobile app similar to private ride-hailing platforms. This app would offer rides to cab drivers with minimal or no commission.\n\nAt the same meeting, Reddy promised accidental insurance of Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh health cover for gig and platform workers. ""In no time, a government order regarding accidental insurance was released. But the problem here is that there is no data on workers. The government is supporting our welfare, and it is a matter of time,"" says Shaik Salauddin, president of TGPWU. At the union office in Amberpet, dozens of workers gather daily to seek solutions to their grievances and Salauddin is busy guiding them through the document work.\n\nThe union\'s major demands are the constitution of a welfare board for gig and platform workers, a uniform rate card that ensures minimum fare for rides, and social security for workers, including scholarships and loans for workers\' children. So far, the government has prepared a draft policy on gig and platform workers and conducted stakeholder meetings.\n\nSalauddin had walked along with Rahul Gandhi during the Congress leader\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra in the state. According to him, he could appraise Gandhi of the problems faced by the workers over a 29-minute conversation during the walk.\n\nUnder Ashok Gehlot, the previous Congress government in Rajasthan passed a first-of-its-kind legislation - Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act. The Karnataka Congress government is also ready with a similar legislation to be passed in the Assembly.\n\n""The works on an app that will be the government\'s version of a ride-hailing platform is underway in Karnataka. Something like the \'Kerala Savari\' app owned by the Kerala government but a more robust one. We want an umbrella app where all aggregator platforms and drivers are available onboard a single portal owned by the government, and customers get to choose which company offers the best rates. This way, the transport department can monitor the activities of companies and workers. This will also provide required data on workers at one place and ensure transparency in operations, algorithm and payment mechanism,"" explains Salauddin.\n\nThe union\'s confidence comes from the fact that the Congress government has been warm and welcoming towards workers and their problems. In the meeting in December, CM Reddy said the government was working on a special app through T-Hub, the Telangana government\'s startup ecosystem, similar to private ride-hailing platforms.\n\nHe even issued a warning to aggregator companies against the exploitation of workers. ""These companies should prioritise the welfare of workers and if anyone fails to take care of them, the government will not hesitate to take strict action against them. How you have conducted yourself so far is one; from now on, the government is watching,"" he said amidst loud applause from workers.\n\nOn November 27, a few days before the Telangana elections, Rahul Gandhi met with a group of gig and platform workers in Hyderabad. He assured them that the Congress government would address all their grievances.\n\nHowever, even after half a year, there has yet to be any progress regarding such an app, and workers wonder how much time it requires to develop one. ""Such an app does not require the government to spend huge amounts of money. If the government leads from the front, all others will fall in line,"" says one of the workers at the union office, wishing not to be named.\n\nT-Hub sources, when contacted, said the government had sought their suggestions regarding the proposal. ""At least four private players are now in the market moving into slightly different models, varying capabilities and features. We have evaluated and passed on a set of recommendations to the government,"" they said.\n\nMana Yatri was one such private app that was launched with government support earlier this year. Many such private apps are onboarded with the Union government\'s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) network.\n\nLaunched by Juspay Technologies, Mana Yatri is a zero-commission ride-hailing app that works on a subscription model and is similar to \'Namma Yatri\' in Bengaluru. The driver here pays a daily commission instead of a certain commission rate on each ride.\n\nA senior official in the IT department denied any such work in progress to develop a ride-hailing app that will be owned and operated by the state government. ""Any app has to be done through a private agency. It is approved and authorised by the Telangana government,"" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, IT Minister D Sridhar Babu said the labour department was working on a policy for gig and platform workers, though he did not know its intricacies. ""Maybe they will table this policy in the next Assembly session. It is about the welfare of those who are not recognised as organised contract workers. Rajasthan has a model policy that the Congress government formulated. And when we formed the government, we spoke to all these people: Ola, Uber, Swiggy. The labour department is taking care of it,"" the minister told indianexpress.com.\n\nAs the government is working on legislation, the labour department is also developing a policy that establishes a workers\' welfare board. The policy proposes to collect contributions from aggregator companies to provide social security benefits such as education scholarships and maternity benefits to workers and their families. Moreover, it suggests implementing a contributory old-age pension scheme.\n\nThe government also wants to ensure minimum wages and grievance redressal mechanisms. Consultations regarding these are progressing with different stakeholder companies. Additional Commissioner of Labour E Gangadhar said the department would soon launch an app that would allow workers to self-register along with their details. This would cover workers employed in ride-hailing, food delivery, other app-based e-commerce platforms, and the gig economy.\n\nThe policy will be based on a study undertaken by the Telangana government\'s Centre for Good Governance. The study examined a worker\'s number of duty hours, service conditions, income particulars, debts or loans, and socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nAccording to Gangadhar, no app will replace private ride-hailing or e-commerce platforms, and the soon-to-be-released government app will register workers into the board for department purposes for covering insurance and other benefits as there is no data on how many people in the state are employed with various gig and platform-based apps.\n\n""We are almost ready with the app, talking with vendors, and correcting technical glitches. The gig policy is also almost ready. We will have another consultation meeting with stakeholders and release it to the public in another week or so,"" the officer added.\n\nAs per a recent study titled \'Prisoners on Wheels?\' done by Paigam (People\'s Association in Grassroots Action and Movement) and the University of Pennsylvania 2024, which interviewed over 10,000 respondents from eight cities, including Hyderabad, over 99 per cent of drivers faced some form of physical health issues while 98.5 per cent experienced anxiety, stress and depression due to work.\n\nThe report also said 80 per cent of cab drivers and 73 per cent of delivery agents found the current fares or rates unsatisfactory, and nearly 75 per cent of all workers found it difficult to manage expenses. About 35 per cent of drivers reported that companies deduct up to 40 per cent commission per ride and 65 per cent of drivers said they faced arbitrary and unexplained deductions from the apps. It also noted that nearly 80 per cent worked for over 10 hours a day, and about 41 to 48 per cent did not have a single day off in a week.\n\nFurther, 47 per cent of cab drivers and 41.5 per cent of delivery persons faced some form of violence at work. The study also found that 83 per cent of cab drivers and 87 per cent of delivery persons said they were negatively affected by companies\' ID blocking. The state government is seriously considering key recommendations from the study.'"
334,334,"b'With this padyatra, which will begin in the last week of July, party sources said Selja is also trying to convey her show of strength to the party high command ahead of the Haryana Assembly elections. In announcing a state-level event and bypassing the Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC), Selja has also indicated she has the backing of the party high command for her padyatra, they added.\n\nWhile talking to The Indian Express, HPCC chief Udai Bhan said, ""She is a general secretary in the AICC. She has announced her programme. It was not discussed with us, but it is good if she is taking out this padyatra.

Additionally, people will be informed in detail about the misrule of the BJP\'s 10 years,"" Selja said.\n\nThe focus of the padyatra, Selja said, would be the urban Assembly areas in Haryana. ""The main objective of the padyatra is to strengthen the Congress in urban Assembly areas compared to the BJP and gain a decisive advantage... With the Assembly elections approaching, Congress needs to focus on urban Assembly areas under a new strategy. Therefore, I have decided to conduct a padyatra in urban areas to strengthen the party,"" she said\n\nA study of the Lok Sabha election results done by the Congress party has shown that the BJP gained an edge in 44 Assembly areas in Haryana, most of which are urban.\n\nInvoking Rahul Gandhi\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra, the ""biggest yatra in the history of the country,"" the former Union minister said, ""He travelled from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Manipur to Maharashtra to fight for the common people. He talked to every section of society, understood their pain, and communicated the Congress message to them. Inspired by him, a Congress message yatra was conducted in Haryana in January-February, the result of which was clearly seen in the Lok Sabha elections.

335,335,"b'NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi\'s speech attacking leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, saying they were not Hindus in the true sense rocked the Lok Sabha on Monday, leading to furious protests by BJP lawmakers including Prime Minister Narendra Modi who intervened to counter the leader\'s charges.\n\nPM Modi took strong exception to Rahul Gandhi\'s remarks that those who call themselves Hindus had engaged in ""violence and hate"" and said, ""To call the entire Hindu society as violent is a very serious issue."" Gandhi, however, insisted that he was speaking about the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Singh (RSS), and not the entire Hindu society.\n\nGandhi\'s frontal attack on the BJP during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President\'s Address also criticised the central government for the Agniveer scheme and not ensuring that farmers got a good price for their crop, leading Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to counter the Congress leader\'s statements and demanding his apology.\n\nGandhi did not budge. ""For the last ten years, there has been a systematic, full-scale assault on the Constitution, on the idea of India and also on those millions of people who resisted the idea of the concentration of power and wealth of the country and aggression on poor, minorities, tribals. They were crushed. I was attacked by an order of this government and the PM. 20 plus cases have been filed against me. ED interrogated me for 55 hours. I have been given a two-year jail sentence. My house has been taken away. There has been a relentless attack on media,"" Gandhi said in his first speech in the 18th Lok Sabha.\n\n""When you are under attack, you need ideas to defend you. To defend the idea of India, I found inspiration from Lord Shiva. I got the protection of Shiv ji,"" Gandhi said, holding up a poster featuring Lord Shiva.\n\nGandhi claimed God Shiva\'s image manifests the idea of non-violence and that no one should fear and went on to say: ""In the history of India, there are three foundational ideas: this country is a country of non-violence and without any fear. On the other hand: those who call themselves Hindus, they talk about fear and untruth. In Hindu religion, it is clearly written... fight for truth... You are not Hindu,"" Gandhi told the ruling BJP.\n\n""You spread fear. The opposition\'s response was Bharat Jodo Yatra. You have scared women through price rise. I met a family of an Agniveer. I call him a martyr. But Modi calls him Agniveer. There is no pension for him, there is no status of a martyr. Agniveer is a use-and-throw mazdoor. You are creating differences between soldiers.""\n\nDefence minister Rajnath Singh strongly refuted Gandhi\'s claims and said, ""LoP shouldn\'t mislead the house by giving wrong speeches. If an Agniveer dies during war or at border, his family gets \xe2\x82\xb91 crore."" Home minister Amit Shah also rose to stress the point. ""He should give the factual position... Otherwise, he should apologize.""\n\nGandhi refused. ""I have spoken. Rajnath Singh has stated his position. The people of the country know what is the truth. His speech or my speech would not make any difference. The country knows Agniveer is not the scheme of the army... it is a scheme of the PM.\n\nRajnath again stood up to refute Gandhi\'s claim, ""158 organizations were consulted before this scheme was launched. It is a well-planned scheme. Such schemes are there in different countries including UK and US... His remarks should be expunged.""\n\nGandhi brushed aside the protests, reiterating that when the Opposition alliance comes to power in the future, the Agniveer scheme would be scrapped.\n\nHe also attacked the BJP over J&K and Manipur. ""For the first time in history, you have taken away a state.. you have thrown Manipur into chaos. The PM didn\'t go to Manipur even once. It seems as if Manipur is not a state for PM and HM. It looks as if there is no civil war in Manipur.""\n\nGandhi also took a swipe at Modi, saying the prime minister had said that he has a direct connection with the God"" which probably told him to take decisions such as demonetisation and implement a flawed GST.\n\n""MSMEs have been destroyed. Job creation\'s backbone is broken due to demonetisation... It was done for Adani, Ambani ji. IT department harasses small entrepreneurs. Even in Gujarat, small traders said, it was done for billionaires. Narendra Modi works for billionaires.""\n\n""To scare farmers, you have destroyed the land law which we made. Then you brought three laws. The PM said it will benefit farmers. the truth is that it was to benefit Adani, Ambani. Farmers opposed and you called them terrorists,"" Gandhi said amid an uproar.\n\nGandhi added that ""NEET students spend years to prepare for exams. And the truth is NEET students don\'t believe in exams and it is designed for rich people and not for meritorious people. This creates a quota for rich people. The students study but don\'t know if the exams will be leaked or not.""\n\nTurning to speaker Om Birla, Gandhi recalled the moments shortly after he was re-elected as presiding officer of the House. ""When you were going to that chair, I walked with you there. You are the final arbitrator in Lok Sabha and all these things define our democracy. There are two people: Speaker of the Indian Union and Mr. Om Birla. I saw you were straight when you shook my hands. But you bent to shake Modi\'s hands.""\n\nBirla defended his gesture and said, ""My culture and traditions tell me to show respect to people who are senior to me. Also, the Prime Minister is the Leader of the House."" Gandhi said he accepted Birla\'s stand but also told him ""You are the tallest leader in this House. You should never bow before anyone.""'"
336,336,"b'New Delhi/ Jaipur In the winter of 2023, Sanjna Jatav was at a difficult crossroads. Just 25, the mother of two had just suffered a narrow defeat in the assembly elections in Rajasthan after being trounced by the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate by 409 votes. Days later, even as the cultivator family was reeling from the loss, her father died. Heartbroken and bereaved, with two toddlers to take care of, it seemed curtains for Jatav\'s still-fledgling political career.\n\nSix months on, the contrast couldn\'t be sharper as Jatav ascended the steps of the new Parliament building this week, her head shielded from the scalding sun by the canopy of her sky blue saree, her mother and mother-in-law standing in the background.\n\nWalking down to the lectern that day to take oath as one of the youngest members of Parliament, she could scarcely believe what the last six months had brought her - a parliamentary ticket from the Congress, a campaign in the BJP stronghold that forced chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma to respond with a roadshow, and erasing a 300,000 vote deficit with a 17 percentage point vote share swing to register an improbable victory.\n\n""If it happened, it all happened because of ordinary people. They\'re the ones who funded me, they\'re the ones who defeated the BJP,"" she said.\n\nThe Dalit woman\'s achievement was representative of the Congress\'s revival in a state where it had drawn a blank in the last two general elections, and her rooted campaign and youthful spontaneity - seen in the impromptu dance she broke into the moment results were announced on June 4 - part of why the opposition party improved its strike rate against the BJP in head-to-head contests from 9% in 2019 to 28% now. Most of all, the Opposition\'s narrative that the BJP will effect changes in the Constitution struck a chord with Dalit people such as Jatav, helping her consolidate that important base. ""The BJP had thought they could win on the basis of PM Modi\'s name alone. But the ordinary man, the ordinary Dalit was angry, and it reflected in the result.""\n\nBorn in 1998 in Bharatpur district, Jatav married police constable Kaptan Singh at 18 in Alwar district\'s Kathumar town. That year was also her first foray into politics when the village panchayat seat Singh\'s father held was reserved for women. Jatav held a graduate degree in arts, and was a fresh young face. She won the election by 4,000 votes. ""It was a big deal for me, coming from a small family of farmers,"" she said.\n\nJatav had joined the Congress shortly before the election, and the muck of mainstream politics didn\'t leave her untouched. Alarmed by her rise, a rival leader dug a deep pit outside her house and registered a complaint against Singh with the Rajasthan Police. ""They started troubling her family,"" said Congress leader Bhupendra Gurjar.\n\nIn 2022, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra passed through Rajasthan, giving Jatav an opportunity to sink deeper roots in the party organisation. She helped prepare for the yatra in Alwar; she also participated in Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra\'s Ladki Hun Lad Sakti Hun campaign, holding meetings and rallies and bringing many young girls into the party fold.\n\nDuring the yatra, Sanjana met Priyanka Gandhi, who was impressed with her work. She told Bhanwar Jitendra Singh, a former Congress MP from Alwar, to groom Jatav, said a senior Congress leader. She got the ticket for the 2023 assembly elections but lost.\n\n""Woh mushkil daur tha (it was a difficult period). I was jolted. An election is a big thing for an ordinary person. It was very difficult to get out of it for 2-3 months. My father\'s absence rankled,"" she said.\n\nFighting another election was not on the cards at the point. ""We didn\'t even have enough money,"" her husband Singh said.\n\nBut politics was slowly creeping back into her life.When the Congress was deciding candidates for the Bharatpur Lok Sabha seat, local leaders thought Jatav could be a fresh face and a strong candidate against the BJP, which had also dropped its incumbent.\n\nWhen she started campaigning, Jatav realised she had a chance. ""The public wanted a change from the high-handed attitude of the previous winners,"" she said.\n\nBharatpur was a prestige seat for the BJP because it is the home district of chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma, and the National Democratic Alliance held seven of the eight assembly segments that make up the constituency. ""We knew that our USP was rootedness so we went to every village, every home even as our opponents were confident that the PM\'s name would make him win. Everywhere people told us they didn\'t have employment or amenities such as water.""\n\nThroughout the campaign, they did three things - keep the focus on local amenities and lack of opportunities in Bharatpur to not allow the BJP to make the election national, talk about the Constitution and the perceived threat to protections for marginalised groups, and the Congress as a genuine alternative in a state where the chief minister is facing some internal dissension. ""We are poor people but people themselves arranged vehicles for us. People were distressed and they made their voices heard,"" she said.\n\nLife has come full circle for the family since June 4. Yet, Jatav finds herself balancing her old persona of a rural woman with her new identity as one of India\'s 543 parliamentarians. ""These few days in Delhi are only an intermission. I wake up at 4am everyday to feed the buffaloes, finish household chores, then cook for the children and get them ready, before tending to the fields,"" she said.\n\nAs she spoke, her four-year-old sauntered in from another room, hungry. Quickly coddling him, Jatav turned to her husband. ""We are ordinary people. Our friends are ordinary. Our relatives are ordinary. We didn\'t have a single important person in our phone books,"" she said. ""But, you know, such ordinary people are 90% of the country."" Jatav nodded in agreement: ""That\'s why we won.""'"
337,337,"b'But the truth is that there is no great success without failure. And, it may include epic electoral failures, which could threaten to finish off a leader\'s political career.\n\nGandhi has faced two consecutive Lok Sabha election defeats and failure at several state assembly polls. He has faced dissent from senior party leaders over his style of functioning and there were voices, both inside and outside his party, which argued that he was a disaster for the Congress.\n\nGandhi took electoral defeats and failures in his stride and tried to reinvent himself with every fall. His Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022 was a landmark in that transformation as he walked from Kanyakumari to Kashmir covering 3,570 km in close to five months, getting him both noticed and appreciated for his endurance and fight against the seemingly infallible might of the ruling party.\n\nThat long walk was more than a journey: It was the first major step, which helped Gandhi transform his image from a political scion to a national leader.\n\nThe Yatra also laid the foundation for the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral performance, in which Congress won 99 seats, even though it appeared in the doldrums after the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\nGandhi consistently harped on caste census to back his slogan of ""Jitni Aabadi Utna Haq"" (rights as per population proportion) and did not fall into the Bharatiya Janata Party\'s (BJP) trap of turning polls into a fight between Hindu religion and others. He constantly spoke about the backwards, minorities, farmers and the poor even at the risk of repeating himself.\n\nHe was able to send a message to people that he was concerned about their well-being and that the policies of the ruling BJP had made the lives of common citizens difficult. His frequent claim that the BJP government was Adani-Ambani\'s government also found resonance among people and he was perceived as one leader, who was constantly speaking against the BJP.\n\nOpinion and exit polls during and before the Lok Sabha election did not give the Congress more than 60-70 seats, and the party winning 99 seats was seen as an achievement against the ""mighty"" and ""resource-rich"" BJP. Although still far from the majority mark of 273 in Lok Sabha, the performance indicated that the Congress can bounce back - but only if it strengthens its on-ground party network and reaches and focuses on people-centric issues.\n\nTo be sure, five years is a long time in politics.\n\nEven after the polls, Gandhi has ticked the right boxes by raising critical issues in the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha: The farmers\' demands, the alleged NEET paper leak and the problem of unemployment.\n\nGandhi\'s maiden speech as leader of the Opposition was one of the sharpest speeches delivered by an Opposition leader in Lok Sabha for a decade or so.\n\nAfter the session, Gandhi\'s visit to the camps of the displaced in Manipur - victims of a 14-month-long ethnic strife in the state -- showed his seriousness about raising people-centric issues in Parliament. He also visited the homes of victims of the Hathras stampede in which 121 people were killed, even though he did not speak against Suraj Pal alias Bhole Baba, who was holding the religious congregation where the incident happened.\n\nWhile Gandhi may be ticking the right boxes, his party appears to be replicating the BJP model of attempting to weaken the opposition. The Congress has inducted at least eight lawmakers from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana in the past fortnight. The party also gave tickets to turncoats in the Lok Sabha polls within days of their joining, undermining its own leaders and workers, and indicating that it is no different from the BJP in certain electoral matters.\n\nHowever, the 13 assembly by-poll results on Saturday showed voters don\'t generally favour turncoats. Here are examples: In Himachal, the two independents, Hoshyar Singh and K L Thakur, who resigned from the assembly, and joined the BJP, lost to Congress, and the third independent, Ashish Sharma, won by a slender margin of 1,571 votes.\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, Congress turncoat and BJP candidate, Kamlesh Pratap Shah, won by a thin margin of about 3,000 votes after trailing to Congress candidate Dheeran Invati for 14 of the 21 rounds. In Uttarakhand\'s Badrinath, Congress turncoat and BJP candidate Rajendra Singh Bhandari lost to Congress candidate Lakhpat Singh Butola by over 5,000 votes, even though in bypolls people usually prefer the ruling party candidate. BJP is the ruling party in Uttarakhand.\n\nThe positive outcome of recent elections provides a glimmer of hope for Gandhi. He should not let his connection with people wither and must fulfil his duties as an effective Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha. He needs to visit states such as Andhra Pradesh and Odisha where the Congress has a chance to grab the main opposition space. Gandhi needs to break his party\'s electoral dilemma in Gujarat and Rajasthan, the two important Hindi heartland states, where the Congress is the main opposition party and where it cannot piggyback on alliance partners.\n\nAs the BJP appears to cede space with Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting old and his replacement not apparent, it is the right time for Rahul Gandhi to shake off the shackles of past electoral setbacks and emerge as a national leader.'"

To be sure, Venugopal had not gone public about the receipt of the threat notification in October.\n\n""It is quite clear what happened here. We know that the Pegasus operation can only be done through a government organisation. Private individuals cannot get it. ...

Apple has been kind enough to intimate me about this special present of yours! Let\'s be clear, the Modi government is acting in a criminal and unconstitutional manner, going after political opponents and invading their privacy in this manner.

Speaker sir, so the idea that you can run the House efficiently by silencing the voice of the Opposition is a non-democratic idea,"" Gandhi said.\n\nBut the Congress leader also took the first opportunity in the House to remind how the Opposition is stronger this time and capable to assert itself better than the previous two Lok Sabhas. ""This House represents the voice of India\'s people and you (speaker) are the final arbiter of that voice. Of course, the government has political power, but the Opposition also represents the voice of India\'s people and this time, the Opposition represents significantly more voice of the Indian people than it did the last time,"" Gandhi said.\n\nGandhi added that the Opposition ""would like to assist"" the speaker in doing his work and wants the House to ""function often and well"" but added, ""It is very important that co-operation happens on the basis of trust. It is very important that the voice of the Opposition is allowed to be represented in this House. I am confident that you will allow us to represent our voice, allow us to speak, allow us to represent the voice of the people of India.""\n\nGandhi escorted Birla, soon after he was re-elected as the new speaker, to the Chair along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju.

When a member wants to speak, they must raise their hand to indicate this to the Speaker while pressing the grey button, the manual states.\n\nThe mic is activated from the control room only when the member has been permitted by the Speaker to speak. This activation is indicated in two ways: with the LED ring turning red and the LED on top of the microphone also turning red.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the parliament microphones arose after LoP Rahul Gandhi claimed that his mic was switched off as he tried to address the issue of NEET irregularities.\n\nIn response, Speaker Om Birla stated, ""I don\'t switch off the mic, there\'s no button with me.""\n\nNotably, this is not the first time that the Congress MP made such claims. During his Bharat Jodo Yatra from September 2022 to January 2023, Gandhi asserted several times that he was compelled to hit the streets as the government was ""choking"" the voice of the Opposition by not even letting elected members speak in Parliament.\n\nIn March 2023, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the then Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, wrote to Birla claiming that his microphone had been muted for three days.'"
344,344,"b'Those who criticise PM Modi\'s record in Manipur ignore a simple truth: the facts on the ground tell a different story. From infrastructure to direct benefits, the scale of progress is undeniable - and it\'s impacting millions\n\nThanks to Prime Minister Modi\'s dynamic leadership, Manipur has seen significant progress. Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, seven lakh farmer families are receiving hundreds of crores of rupees. Six lakh families benefit from the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), while 80,000 houses have been built under the PM Awas Yojana (PMAY). The Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PMJAY) has provided free medical treatment to 4.25 lakh patients. Additionally, over 1.5 lakh families received free gas connections and over 1.3 lakh received free electricity connections. Furthermore, 30,000 toilets have been built, and the construction of oxygen plants, which were built in virtually every district during the Covid pandemic, are a testament to how relevant Manipur has been to the Modi government in the larger scheme of things.\n\nRahul Gandhi\'s visit to Manipur last week, on the other hand, was only about wanting to get some brownie points. Don\'t forget that the Congress never mainstreamed Manipur, which continued to suffer from ""tyranny of distance"" under decades of Congress misrule. Modi changed that.\n\nThe Northeast, particularly Manipur, has been the subject of heated debate in recent months. As is typical of the Opposition, it has embarked on a diabolical game of politicising the events in Manipur for narrow political gains. The Modi government has always stood for accountability and good governance. According to keen political observers, what transpired in Manipur last year is a dangerous mix of various factors: rampant poppy cultivation and drug abuse in many areas by notorious narco traders, the hills versus plains controversy, ethno-religious conflict, border tensions arising from the influx of illegal migrants from Myanmar, and all these spiralling into violent lawlessness after the Manipur High Court judgement in April 2023 that said the state government should consider inclusion of Meiteis under the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category.\n\nThe Manipur police had registered a case against unidentified armed persons under sections of abduction, gang rape and murder at Nongpol Sekmai police station in Thoubal district on May 18, 2023. The CBI, last year, took over the FIR registered by the Manipur police as per the agency\'s procedure. The CBI then deployed a special investigation team (SIT) in Manipur under a DIG-rank officer. Multiple arrests have been made with respect to the horrific incident of the gangrape of two Kuki women, with every BJP leader demanding nothing less than capital punishment for the culprits. Buffer zones have been created to prevent escalation of conflicts and a significant amount of illicit grenades, rifles, live cartridges and ammunition have reportedly been seized from militant groups. Over 50,000 people from Manipur have been rehabilitated and evacuated to safety by the Modi government.\n\nLast year, the Central government asked the Supreme Court to transfer the Manipur violence case trial outside of the state, aiming to ensure a free and fair trial. The Centre also requested the apex court expedite the trial for all cases related to the Manipur violence, including the gang rape case. Furthermore, under the Ministry of Home Affairs directive, the campaign to collect biometric data from illegal Myanmar immigrants in Manipur has resumed with increased intensity.\n\nLook at the stark contrast: while the Modi government voluntarily handed over the Manipur case to the CBI, you have a thoroughly insensitive TMC government under an equally insensitive and rudderless Mamata Banerjee, who spent taxpayer funds to petition the Kolkata High Court repeatedly, opposing a CBI probe into the gory 2023 Sandeshkhali gangrape cases involving senior TMC leader Shahjahan Sheikh. Law and order has collapsed in West Bengal under Mamata. Similarly, a few months ago, in a classic case of love jihad, Neha Hiremath was murdered in cold blood by a radical Islamist in Congress-ruled Karnataka. Rahul Gandhi hasn\'t had time to visit Neha\'s family, but he is quick to visit Manipur, purely driven by political opportunism.\n\nNow the moot question is, has the BJP done enough for Manipur? Yes, the BJP and the Modi government have been working tirelessly, engaging in multiple rounds of talks between the warring Kuki and Meitei factions. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has held several all-party meetings on the Manipur issue in recent months and has maintained constant contact with various stakeholders to achieve a peaceful resolution. He has frequently visited Manipur and stationed himself there for extended periods. In sharp contrast, during similar violence in the mid-1990s under the erstwhile Congress regime, the Congress didn\'t even consider it necessary to send their Home Minister. They simply sent their MoS Home, Rajesh Pilot, to defuse the situation. Pilot spent a mere 3 hours in Manipur before hastily returning to Delhi - a brazen display of insensitivity and callousness.\n\nThat Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the Northeast over 50 times -- and his Cabinet ministers over 400 times in the last ten years -- is a testimony to the fact that PM Modi never allowed the ""tyranny of distance"" to prevent his government from working for the welfare of the Northeast. In stark contrast, former PM Manmohan Singh of the Congress was a Rajya Sabha MP from 1991 till 2019 from Assam for 28 long years, but he did not visit the region even three times during this period. Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who moved the no-confidence motion against the Modi government last year, is the son of Tarun Gogoi. Despite serving as Chief Minister of Assam for 15 years (the longest tenure), Tarun Gogoi did precious little for the people of Assam.\n\nIn fact, it was the Modi government that brought broad gauge rail to large parts of Assam and Tripura in 2016 and Sikkim\'s first full-fledged airport in 2018. Contrast this with the Congress\'s handling of the Bogibeel Bridge. Started in 2002, work on this vital bridge over the Brahmaputra River in Assam was abandoned when the Congress came to power at the Centre in 2004. The Modi government ultimately completed this combined road-and-rail bridge -- India\'s longest and Asia\'s second longest -- which can withstand earthquakes up to magnitude 7 and boasts a lifespan of approximately 120 years.\n\nThe Dhola Sadiya Bridge tells a similar story. Construction began in 2011, only to be abandoned midway by the Congress. Yet again, it was the Modi government that completed the project in 2017, delivering this vital beam bridge that serves as the first permanent road link between northern Assam and eastern Arunachal Pradesh. Clearly, mainstreaming the Northeast through infrastructural connectivity has been a signature achievement of PM Modi\'s tenure. The limited point is this -- successive Congress governments at the Centre did absolutely nothing to mainstream the Northeast with the rest of India, for decades altogether. This arduous task has been deftly consummated by PM Modi and his team.\n\nIt\'s no surprise then that the BJP romped home to victory for the second time in a row in the 2021 Assam Assembly elections. In the Tripura Assembly elections in 2023, while the Congress was reduced to just 3 seats, the BJP won consecutively for the second time in a row, with a solid 32 seats. Since Manipur became a state on 21 January 1972, the last seven years under the double-engine BJP government have been the most peaceful in Manipur\'s 52-year-old history, barring the last few months. But to focus solely on these past few months while disregarding the commendable work of the BJP government in Manipur over the last seven years exposes the Opposition\'s rabid hypocrisy.\n\nMore than anything else and beyond electoral politics, the events of the last few months in Manipur are largely a simmering legacy issue and the result of the Congress party\'s abject lethargy when it ruled the Northeast for the longest time. For instance, the Assam Accord of 1985 was signed when Rahul Gandhi\'s father, Rajiv Gandhi, was the PM, but nothing was done to empower indigenous Assamese people. That work was done by the Modi government. Similarly, the 1986 Mizo Accord, also signed during Rajiv Gandhi\'s tenure, saw its promises fulfilled only by the responsive Modi government, decades later. The 1988 Tripura Accord met the same fate - signed under Rajiv Gandhi but enacted under Modi. Even the Karbi-Anglong and Bodo Accords, signed during Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao\'s term, saw elections for their respective councils only in 2020-21, thanks to the commitment of the Modi government.\n\nHow many times did Rahul Gandhi visit Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland or Tripura since 2004, when he became a Member of Parliament? Barely. Don\'t forget, Rahul\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra ended on January 30, 2023. Assembly elections in Tripura were held on February 16, 2023, but he did not visit Tripura even once. Again, Assembly elections were held in Meghalaya and Nagaland on February 27, 2023, and yet again, Rahul Gandhi did not visit Nagaland even once. As for Meghalaya, he had a whistle-stop tour for a few hours in Shillong. That shows the lack of commitment on the part of the Congress party which has now suddenly woken up from deep slumber and has been whipping up passions, just when things are returning to normalcy in Manipur. Again, don\'t forget, in 2010-11, under the Congress rule both at the Centre and in Manipur, there were times when crippling curfews lasted for anywhere between 124 to 139 days at a stretch. How many times did Rahul Gandhi visit Manipur in 2010-11? Not even once.\n\nIn a historic first, S. Phangnon Konyak became the first Naga woman to be appointed to the Rajya Sabha in 2023. She also holds the distinctions of being the first-ever female Vice-Chairperson from the Northeast in the Rajya Sabha and the first woman from the region to preside over its proceedings. That it took 76 years in post-independent India for a Naga woman to become a member of the distinguished House of Elders is a tad surprising. However, that it happened under the aegis of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hardly surprising. His commitment to women-led development and outreach to the Northeast is unparalleled.\n\nViolence erupted in Manipur on May 3, 2023, sparked by a ""tribal solidarity march"" organised by the Kuki community in the hill districts. The march aimed to protest the majority Meitei community\'s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. This demand had been gaining momentum, with Meitei groups arguing that successive governments had ignored their pleas for inclusion in the ST list for over a decade. The situation escalated when, acting on a petition by the Meetei (Meitei) Tribe Union, the Manipur High Court directed the state government to expedite the Meitei community\'s request for ST status and send a recommendation to the Union government within four weeks. Experts view this as the tipping point that ignited the violence.\n\nThousands participated in the solidarity march called by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) across all ten hill districts, to oppose the demand for inclusion of the Meitei community in the ST category, say observers. The ATSUM said the march had been organised to express dissent to the ""persistent demands of the Meitei community for its inclusion in the ST category"" gaining momentum. While the lawmakers of the valley areas are openly endorsing the Meitei demand, those in the hills are opposed to the same.\n\nIt is pertinent to note here that the Meiteis inhabit the Manipur valley, which constitutes barely 10 per cent of the geographical area of the state. Meiteis claim that they are facing difficulty in view of the large-scale illegal immigration by Myanmarese and Bangladeshis. Compounding the problem additionally for the Meiteis is the fact that they are not allowed to settle in the hill areas as per the existing law. Kukis on the other hand, have benefitted due to colonial-era laws dating back to 1907. The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM), which has been spearheading the movement for the inclusion of the Meiteis in the ST category for more than a decade, has repeatedly said the demand is being made not merely for reservation in jobs, educational institutions and tax relief. It is more about protecting the ancestral lands, culture and identity of the Meitei people, who are threatened constantly by illegal immigrants from Myanmar, Bangladesh and by the Kukis.\n\nThe Meitei community, largely Hindus, account for 60 per cent of the total population in Manipur but occupy only 10 per cent of the land. On the other hand, Kukis and other tribes who are largely Christians by faith, account for only 40 per cent of the population, but occupy and inhabit 90 per cent of the territory. Clearly, as per political observers, it is the systematic marginalisation of the Meitei Hindus over decades together, which finally led to the events as they unfolded post-May 3, 2023. While violence against women has to be condemned and there can be no excuses whatsoever for condoning it, equally, the question that begets a response is - why did the Congress, which ruled India for the longest time at the Centre, never bother to give the Meiteis their rightful dues or accord them their rightful place in Manipur?\n\nEven as over 4600 schools have reopened in Manipur and normalcy is returning, the Opposition led by the likes of the Congress and the TMC, has been attempting to weaponise the narrative around Manipur, with irresponsible politics via futile visits. If TMC leaders can travel from Kolkata to Manipur, which is 1490 km away, why couldn\'t they travel from Kolkata to Howrah, which is just 19 km away, and from Kolkata to Malda, which is just 329 km away? The reason is simple. In Howrah & Malda, it was the BJP\'s women karyakartas who were paraded naked by TMC goons in full public glare. So the TMC or the Congress simply do not care. The Opposition is scavenging on the wounds of the people in Manipur, when the Modi government is doing all it can, and all it should, to heal them.\n\nThe fact that all eight Northeast states have been voting in large numbers in the last ten years for PM Modi\'s inclusive model of governance speaks volumes of how the Modi model has truly ensured last-mile delivery in the Northeast, to those who were barred from even the basic amenities of life under successively repressive regimes of both the Congress and the Left. Kukis in Manipur have always wanted a semi-autonomous region, while Meiteis have only wanted ST status. Many Nagas of Manipur want to be part of ""larger Nagaland"" or Nagalim, as they call it, according to political experts. The Modi government is working tirelessly to reconcile the diverse interests of these warring groups.\n\nThe Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement was signed in 2008 under which, the then Congress government at the Centre was supposed to rehabilitate key Kuki insurgent groups, but as always, Manmohan Singh and his kitchen cabinet led by Sonia Gandhi snoozed on this subject, which widened the fissures between Kukis and Meiteis as time flew by. Today, under the aegis of the Modi government, AFSPA has either been or is being removed, from 15 police station areas in seven districts of Nagaland; 15 police station areas in six districts of Manipur; and 23 districts entirely and one district partially in Assam.\n\nSpecifically speaking about Manipur, the BJP won 32 seats in the Assembly elections in 2022 while the Congress was reduced to a measly 5 seats. That defeat must have deeply hurt the Congress, which is now using the Manipur issue to settle political scores. Even in the 2023 Assembly elections in Nagaland, which has over 93 per cent Christian and tribal population, the BJP and its ally, the NDPP, won 37 seats overall, while the Congress got zero. The electoral annihilation of the Congress in the Northeast is complete and that is precisely why it is using the Manipur issue to regain lost political capital, by stoking the embers of discord.\n\nHowever, thanks to PM Modi\'s relentless and resolute focus on the development of Manipur, the state is returning to normalcy to reclaim its rightful place as the soul of Northeast, with its emerald tea gardens, rolling hills, dense forests and captivating beauty.'"
345,345,"b'Armed and emboldened with a better performance than last time, along with the setback to the BJP in its stronghold of Uttar Pradesh and defeat in Faizabad (Ayodhya), Rahul Gandhi is convinced that it is time to shoot and scoot\n\nAs the Opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi could have intervened to set the house in order and restrain the opposition, but he chose not to. This is the new Congress. The new, brazen and possibly reckless Congress. Gone is the restraint and cautious approach of Gandhi and his supporters when it came to dealing with PM Narendra Modi.\n\nEarlier, many felt that he should not take the PM head-on as it would hurt him and make him look weak. Which is why despite goading by many in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Gandhi used to avoid any direct confrontation with the PM or not even match eye-to-eye. All this has changed now. Why?\n\nWhen the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) first came to power in New Delhi, despite the bitterness of the Congress for having lost the polls, Gandhi had said, ""We need to learn some things from the AAP.""\n\nThey are friends now, but the lesson Gandhi wanted to learn from them then, he has learnt now. The AAP is known to be reckless, combative and as its critics say ""shoot and scoot"". That\'s what Gandhi\'s Congress wants to do now.\n\nArmed and emboldened with a better performance than last time, along with the setback to the BJP in its stronghold of Uttar Pradesh and defeat in Faizabad (Ayodhya), Gandhi is convinced that it is time to shoot and scoot.\n\nShoot at the BJP and PM and then run off and don\'t back off. Be brazen, look the PM straight in the eye. That\'s what Gandhi did with the PM. Looking him in the eye. Naming him, instead of addressing him as the PM and accusing him of many things. This is a different Gandhi from what he was before the Bharat Jodo Yatra and became the Leader of Oppostion (LOP). This the new Congress, which, under Gandhi, wants to do away with any protocol and ensure its voice is raised and heard inside and outside parliament.\n\nEven if it invites criticism and attacks, Congress leaders have made up their minds. Shriek, shout and make yourself heard at every point and stage. Make the point that the opposition has arrived and its voice cannot be silenced.\n\nSaid a senior Congress leader close to the Gandhi brigade, ""We came under pressure and asked many of our leaders to resign. Does the BJP do this? So why should we be meek? Enough is enough.""\n\nThe new Gandhi-led Congress doesn\'t want to turn its other cheek to the BJP if hit on one.\n\nSo, in days to come, one will see the Congress and opposition leaders raise their decibels even more. Can this boomerang?'"
346,346,"b""The 2024 Lok Sabha elections marked a crucial turning point for the Congress. After over a decade, the party managed to secure close to a hundred seats, a significant improvement compared to previous performances. However, while this resurgence may seem impressive on the surface, it is essential to delve deeper into the various critical aspects where the Congress failed to deliver.\n\nDespite the uptick in the seat count, the Congress's performance was lacklustre in several states where it was previously strong. For instance, in Madhya Pradesh, a traditional Congress bastion, the party suffered a severe blow by losing crucial seats such as Chhindwara. This constituency had been a stronghold for Kamal Nath, and its loss indicates deeper structural issues within the party's state-level organisation. In Karnataka, despite being in power, the Congress failed to translate its administrative control into electoral victories, highlighting a disconnect between governance and voter sentiment.\n\nThe 2024 election results also revealed an undercurrent of anti-incumbency against the BJP. Yet, the Congress failed to capitalise on this sentiment effectively. In several states, the Congress's role as the principal opposition was not strong enough to convert public discontent into votes. This failure to harness anti-incumbency sentiments indicates a gap in the party's strategic approach and its ability to present itself as a viable alternative to the ruling party.\n\nMoreover, the Congress' alliance with regional parties in states like Delhi proved disastrous. In Delhi, the Congress formed an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and they contested all seven seats. The alliance did not win a single seat, demonstrating a significant miscalculation in coalition dynamics and voter preferences. This poor performance in coalition politics extends beyond Delhi, affecting the Congress's prospects in other key states.\n\nThe Congress has touted initiatives like the Bharat Jodo Yatra, led by Rahul Gandhi, as pivotal in mobilising grassroots support. However, it remains questionable whether the positive outcomes in some constituencies were genuinely due to these efforts. The effectiveness of such campaigns in translating into widespread electoral success is debatable and needs closer scrutiny.\n\nAnother critical point of concern is the leadership dynamics within the Congress. Mallikarjun Kharge was the party president during the elections, yet the campaign prominently featured the Gandhi family, particularly Rahul Gandhi. Post-election, Rahul Gandhi has been appointed as the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. This focus on the Gandhi family, rather than a broader leadership framework, may contribute to the party's ongoing struggles to present a united and diversified leadership front.\n\nThese setbacks highlight the multifaceted challenges facing the Congress. While the party has made some gains, it must address these underlying issues to position itself as a robust contender in future elections.\n\nThe Congress party's poor performance in Madhya Pradesh in the 2024 Lok Sabha election is alarming and a cause for concern. The party did not win a single seat in the state. The loss is even more striking in Chhindwara, a traditional Congress stronghold and the seat of party leader Kamal Nath's son, Nakul Nath. Chhindwara has been a Congress bastion for decades, and Nakul Nath's defeat is a significant blow to the party.\n\nThe reasons for the Congress's poor performance in Madhya Pradesh are multifaceted. One major factor is the party's inability to connect with the youth and rural voters. The BJP, on the other hand, has been successful in mobilising these segments of the electorate. Additionally, the Congress party's internal conflicts and lack of strong leadership at the state level have also contributed to its poor performance.\n\nThe loss in Chhindwara is particularly significant as it highlights the erosion of the Congress's traditional support base. The party's failure to adapt to changing political dynamics and its inability to address local issues have led to its decline in the state. The Congress needs to introspect and reassess its strategy to regain its lost ground in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe recent election results have exposed significant weaknesses within the Congress party in Karnataka, despite its control of the state government. The party's failure to secure a substantial number of parliamentary seats highlights several critical issues. Despite winning the state assembly election a few months ago, the Congress only secured nine of Karnataka's 28 Lok Sabha seats -- the same number as in the previous election. This stagnation suggests an inability to expand its voter base.\n\nFirstly, infighting has plagued the party. Factionalism within the state Congress has been a persistent problem, with prominent leaders often at odds with each other. This disunity was evident in the run-up to the elections, undermining the party's campaign efforts and confusing voters about its leadership and vision. The tussle between CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar is indeed troubling for the party cadres.\n\nSecondly, there is discontent against the state government's performance. Despite being in power, the Congress-led government in Karnataka has faced criticism over its handling of key issues such as infrastructure development, unemployment, and public services. This dissatisfaction translated into a lack of support at the national level, as voters expressed their disapproval by not backing Congress candidates for the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe general elections highlighted significant strategic errors by the Congress party, particularly in its choice of allies. These missteps played a crucial role in its poor performance, undermining its efforts to present a united front against the BJP.\n\nIn Delhi, the Congress entered into an alliance with AAP, hoping to consolidate the anti-BJP vote. However, this alliance backfired spectacularly. The two parties failed to synergise their campaign efforts effectively, and their differing political philosophies confused voters. Historically, the Congress and AAP have been rivals in Delhi politics, and their sudden collaboration did not resonate well with the electorate. This confusion and lack of coherent strategy led to a complete rout, with the alliance losing all seven seats to the BJP. This outcome starkly highlighted the pitfalls of allying with a party that has a conflicting voter base and strategic priorities.\n\nIn West Bengal, the Congress formed an alliance with the Communist Party of India [Marxist] (CPI[M]), aiming to counter the dominance of both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress (TMC). This coalition, however, failed to gain traction. The ideological differences between the Congress and CPI(M), combined with their historical enmity, diluted their appeal. The voters, instead of rallying behind this alliance, perceived it as an opportunistic move lacking genuine unity of purpose. The result was a dismal performance, with the Congress-CPI(M) alliance failing to win any seats, allowing the TMC and BJP to dominate the electoral landscape.\n\nThese alliances underscore a broader issue within the Congress: the inability to form effective and strategically sound coalitions. The choice of allies seemed more reactive than proactive, lacking a clear understanding of ground realities and voter sentiments. Rather than bolstering its position, these alliances fragmented the Congress's support base and led to electoral defeats in key battleground states.\n\nThe Congress party's dismal performance in the 2024 elections can be attributed to its failure to galvanise its cadres across all states. Despite having a large grassroots presence, the party was unable to mobilise its workers and supporters effectively, leading to a lacklustre campaign.\n\nOne major reason for this failure was the party's inability to project a unified and strong leadership. The lack of a clear hierarchy and decision-making process led to confusion and demotivation among cadres. Additionally, the party's outdated organisational structure and lack of technological adoption made it difficult to reach out to workers and voters effectively.\n\nFurthermore, the Congress's inability to empower its state units and give them autonomy also led to a disconnect between the central leadership and grassroots workers. The result was a lacklustre campaign that failed to inspire voters, leading to a significant decline in the party's vote share. To revive itself, the Congress must reform its organisational structure, adopt technology, and empower its state units to galvanise its cadres and regain its lost ground."""
347,347,"b'Sasikanth Senthil has been a key figure in the Congress\' resurgent performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. Though he prefers to keep a low profile, Senthil (45) won his Lok Sabha election from Tiruvallur, a reserved (Scheduled Caste) constituency in Tamil Nadu, by a margin of over five and a half lakh votes, the highest in the State. Senthil has also been actively involved with the Congress ""war room"" for the general election, which he also helped set up in Karnataka ahead of the 2023 Assembly election.\n\nSenthil, who comes from a Dalit family, studied engineering at NIT Trichy before cracking the civil services exam to become an IAS officer. But he gave it up in 2019 to take up political activism, subsequently joining the Congress. During his swearing-in ceremony as MP, he stood out for highlighting injustice towards minorities, Dalits, and Adivasis, in line with his party\'s social justice plank. In this interview with senior journalist Saba Naqvi, Sasikanth Senthil talks about his journey to Parliament, his stint with the civil services and why he quit, the state of Dalit politics in India, and more. Excerpts:\n\nHow have your initial few days in Parliament been?\n\nGood. It is very humbling for a person like me because the space that I come from, we would not have dreamt to reach this in a matter of 50 to 60 years. It really matters not only for me but for a lot of people from my community and my village.\n\nYou won from the seat of Tiruvallur with a margin of 5.72 lakh, which is the largest in Tamil Nadu. You have cracked an entrance exam, and you have given it up. So, you cannot say it is humbling, you have done all of it and now you are a Member of Parliament. Tell us a little about your background.\n\nI have done all that not without a certain kind of politics. I really feel that it is not only about me and it is not about anybody who are so-called achievers by themselves. You need a certain kind of politics and environment. Given that environment and situation, somebody can prove whatever they can. While growing up, my father used to say that out of the two sons, one is for the house and one is for the country. The one who is for the country, I used to assume that it is me and I have always charted my life like that. Another profound statement he always used to say is that you have to look back at the road that you came from. Wherever I go, I keep thinking where did I come from.\n\nWATCH: The Congress MP from Tiruvallur says that India will never become innovative or creative with the caste system. | Video Credit: Interview by Saba Naqvi; Camera by Dipesh Arora; Production Assistants: Vedaant Lakhera & Kavya Pradeep M.; Editing by Samson Ronald K.; Supervising Producer: Jinoy Jose P.\n\nWhere did you come from?\n\nI come from a first-generation Dalit background. It was my father\'s generation who sucked up all the issues that they had, but there was a kind of politics working in Tamil Nadu which focused on social justice and we had a great push in education because we didn\'t have anything else. With that support, he became a government servant, and then from that point onwards, he always pushed us. So, I come from that visual of my village, my father\'s lifestyle and so on. So, that defines me largely.\n\nBeing from Tamil Nadu, do the fruits of the Dravidian movement also define you? Did they also enable someone like you?\n\nYes, absolutely. Without that, we are not here.\n\nYou cracked the civil services as a rank holder. Please tell us about that journey.\n\nI did my engineering in electronics and communication from NIT Trichy. I was good with computers and that was the computer era too. Then I got into a good company but something was not working, because I had this in my mind that I need to go back and do whatever is required. At some point, I realised I cannot live with machines for a long time. So I resigned from there and joined an NGO.\n\nI worked with the college for some time and tried to see myself in the social space, which I found was working for me. And then I worked for an NGO on participatory rural appraisal techniques. That\'s when someone told me that the government is the biggest NGO and we should try to go there. I saw the civil service, tried applying and in a matter of two years, I cleared the exam.\n\nHow many times did you sit for the entrance?\n\nI cleared it in my third attempt, after two serious attempts. I was the first ranker in Tamil Nadu and ninth in India.\n\nYou were in the Karnataka cadre and your last posting was the DM [District Magistrate] of Mangalore. Then you quit.\n\nI quit the service in 2019 in protest. The politics that brought me there: I saw a threat to that from 2002 onwards, when the Godhra riots happened. How can an elected government engage in something like this? From then, I started seeing the other politics that divide people to win elections. I have been closely watching every aspect of that politics.\n\nIn 2014, when the person who was seen as the perpetrator of everything became the Prime Minister of this country, which I never thought would happen, I was very apprehensive that this is going to go in a different direction. And for the next five years, I watched them very closely, their demonetisation... every aspect of them. Everything was a copybook of the politics which happened all over the world. History books are full of indicators of what our country is going through.\n\nWhat is the phrase you would use for it?\n\nI would say fascist. You can say fascist-like politics or populist but I think it is bordering fascism.\n\nIn 2019, I was the District Election Officer of Mangalore, conducting the whole election, and in that chair you are a neutral person. But I was hoping in a larger sense that this country will give a different signal. It is when they came back to power with a bigger vote share, I thought that this is the time to fight. I would be guilty of not protecting the politics which made me.\n\nThen they abrogated Article 370 and moved the Army into Kashmir. That was shocking but the idea of resigning came when I saw the whole military keep everybody in the State in house arrest.\n\nAlso Read | Sasikanth Senthil, the IAS officer who resigned protesting the \'fascist\' policies of the Central government, joins Congress\n\nSo you actually resigned because of Kashmir?\n\nYeah, I resigned with Kashmir as a trigger. The entire politics gave a big push to fight against this. In the resignation letter, I wrote very clearly that the government has hit upon the fundamentals of a diverse democracy and I am better off outside fighting this rather than sitting inside.\n\nWith your ideology, how did the Congress, which is seen as a status quo party, inspire you?\n\nInitially, I had no idea about political parties. I was bothered about the silence in this country. I thought it would take me at least three years to move around the country and to push people, especially students. I was like a very jittery fisherman who saw the tsunami coming right in the middle of the ocean and who came back to the shore to wake everybody up. I am sure many of us would have felt that. I was apprehensive about the violence because I knew that a fascist government will only have violence as an answer to anything which they can\'t fight.\n\nThen they brought in CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] and NRC [National Register of Citizens]... Anybody who has read Nazi history would know that the first thing [Adolf] Hitler did was to register people and then move them into categories, make differential laws and use it to put them in concentration. So, there was a lot of explaining that had to be done about CAA and NRC and we did that all over the country.\n\nYou did this as a member of the Congress?\n\nNo, it was all independent. Talking to students, individuals, minorities, and especially the majority to make them understand that you are the actual victims. I was continuously travelling all over the country but mostly in closed meetings and not in open forums.\n\nThen Shaheen Bagh happened, and then they started the Delhi riots. That is exactly what I was afraid about, that they will have violence as an answer. And I knew that the violence will not be perpetuated by the government on people, but people will be pitted against each other. That\'s the basic damage any fascist government would do. They will divide people so that the people do the killing and they can just be the observers. Around 150 people were murdered in this and I was running a control room, trying to help people.\n\nHow did the Congress journey begin?\n\nI thought that if innocent people are going to lose their lives, then I should use the political forum, the democratic space, which is still available to fight against them. I went to the Congress by myself because I knew it had the ideological background and the breadth and length to fight them.\n\nWhom did you approach?\n\nI had a senior colleague who was in the Congress. It was when the Tamil Nadu election [in 2021] started, I decided to take the formal plunge into the Congress. I organised the campaign in a very formal and logical way. I organised a small war room and then we worked on that. As I started working with the organisation of the Congress, I started falling in love with it. Because for me, every political party has three major steps; organisation, ideology, and leadership.\n\nIn the Congress, the organisation is not the leaders alone -- it has a huge cadre base. Every village you go to, you will have some 10 Congressmen and women who still believe in empathy, love and affection. So, I started falling in love with that cadre base wherein people think goodness is what they want. So this organisation is giving me that space to move around.\n\nYou are talking about south India. In the north, they seem to have vanished.\n\nNo, they are still there. The connection seems to have vanished. But in every village, if you just rub their surface, they will say that we are actually Rajiv Gandhi fans, Indira Gandhi gave this house, and so on.\n\nI believe that the ideology of Congress is the Constitution and it is the written manifesto of the party. It is the product of the freedom movement, a movement for equity, which was not just against the British but was also bringing the ethos that we have as the Constitution. So, it was natural for me to take up that ideology and work for it.\n\nRahul Gandhi, senior Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. Sasikanth Senthil believes that Rahul understands how India is ""beautifully chaotic"". | Photo Credit: PRIYANSHU SINGH/REUTERS/File Photo\n\nHow do you see Rahul Gandhi today? Is he changing the Congress?\n\nRahul Gandhi is an extremely good human being. He is very sharp and radical. He believes in humanistic principles. In that way, anything associated with him will change.\n\nOne great example is the Bharat Jodo Yatra and it is one of the biggest reasons for our success. The Congress\' language was not rhetoric and big speeches. It was walking. If you have a leader like that who can lead from the front, the organisation will change and it has changed.\n\nRahul Gandhi, as a member of the family, has just taken a position in the government for the first time. Does that mean that we will now see him as a prime ministerial candidate or is it inevitable that the Congress will see him in the future?\n\nI am not a great fan of what is going to come in the future. But I can very clearly tell that he is a leader with all the character and aspects which this country is all about.\n\nAre you talking about finding morality in public life again?\n\nNot only that, you need a certain mind to understand India. In India, we don\'t tolerate differences, we celebrate it. We are beautifully chaotic and one needs to understand that. And I think Rahul Gandhi is someone who clearly understands that and can lead everybody towards.\n\n""The BJP and RSS are making the Muslims the new Dalits.""\n\nAs a Dalit MP, at what stage are we in our own history as far as Ambedkar\'s vision is considered? And what exactly has happened in Uttar Pradesh or Maharashtra, has there been a shift in the Dalit politics or is it impossible to generalise?\n\nI think we were in the right direction until we forgot to do what Ambedkar told us to do in the last speech, that is social freedom. I would even expand that a little and talk about caste as a very important factor. The entire burden of the caste system is borne by the Dalits. It is a graded hierarchy, as Ambedkar says. So, when someone propagates caste, even through a surname, we may not know what impact it has even if they are not casteist. When we do a bit of propagation for that, the burden of that whole caste system is borne by the Dalits because they are at the bottom most.\n\nAs far as questioning the caste system, we have not gone much further. We have kind of stopped some atrocities here and there but largely we are a casteist society. And casteism, patriarchy, etc.: these are all sister brothers, there is not much difference. So, we have to understand the caste system and discuss how it propagates.\n\nTowards what Ambedkar visualised, I don\'t think we have gone a long distance but we were in the direction: as long as we thought in a legal, rational system and we moved, we upheld affirmative action, and I am a product of that. But a lot needs to be done to understand the whole nexus. You cannot just address Dalits as such. It is the system.\n\nAre Muslims even at the lowest in society now? Can we make an equation between communities and caste?\n\nThe problemwith caste is that there is no escape route. Your marriage, love, and everything is restricted. You cannot move out of that space at all. And generations together, you cannot move. You have an occupation associated with you as well that keeps reminding you who you are.\n\nWith communalism, there might be escape routes. But with the BJP and the RSS, interestingly I observed that they are actually making the Muslims the new Dalits.\n\nYou were in Mangalore, where there is quite a lot of wealth with the Muslim community. Just explain the equations right now.\n\nWherever the lowest of social strata gathers wealth, there will be violence... Caste and communalism will become stronger. So, this idea of ""I am up and you are down"" has to be re-established in society through certain practices. The only smart way we found in governance is affirmative action to bring up a community so that it is equal.\n\nBut Muslims cannot get reservation, except through caste groups.\n\nBecause caste has two escape routes. There is this idea of pollution, which is now being talked about the Muslims. During COVID-19, they brought in this Tablighi Jamaat.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that the biggest caste is women. Everything that is there in a caste system is there in women too. They talk about purity, when women can be touched. They cannot have their love life and there is a divine ordinance on how they should behave and everything. So it is all the same. It is all a very intelligent system of hierarchies built.\n\nWe have not gone further and will never grow further if we do not deal with this caste system. Also, India will never become innovative or creative with the caste system, because the head that thinks is with someone and the hands that work are with someone else. They both will not mingle. And if you don\'t mingle these two things, you will never innovate.\n\nWe are good in theory. We are good at many other things but we don\'t create stuff. Because this habit of creating is not right, it is not there. So a caste has to be on the head and some caste has to be on the hand.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla after installing the sengol at the inauguration of the new Parliament building, in New Delhi, on May 28, 2023. Sasikanth Senthil believes that if the sengol is construed to be something like a stick, it better go away. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nDo you think we are seeing a transformation: like the Bahujan Samaj Party, for instance, is declining. We have another young MP in Parliament, Chandrashekhar Azad. So are these new voices?\n\nThese voices are very important and they come up with the right understanding of Dalit politics. So I\'m very happy to see many more youngsters coming up and putting up a system to fight. But it is also very easy to get deviated into some other fights. So that has its own political churning and it is happening. But I would not say that we have come a long way. The society has not come a long way in patriarchy and caste system.\n\nThere is suddenly a demand that the Sengol should be withdrawn. Does it represent anything for Tamil people?\n\nI don\'t think so. The only thing is that it came from Tamil Nadu. Sengol represents justice.\n\nDoes it represent justice or monarchy?\n\nWhen you have a monarchy and extraordinary power in your hand, it is very important to have that idea of justice, equity and fraternity. It is not just a stick to rule. Ethically managing power is important and I think it represents that. But if it is construed to be something like a danda, it better go away.\n\nIt is interesting that the Samajwadi Party MP [R.K. Chaudhary] has written to remove that in place of the Constitution.\n\nI would surely agree because I know what the Constitution is. I don\'t have an interpretation there. I would certainly agree with that.\n\nWould you agree with the proposition to replace the sengol and put the Constitution back?\n\nWhen there is this Constitution, which is a written, legal, rational thing, I value it much above any kind of symbolism. Today, I see in many churches, people have put the Preamble; in many houses, I\'ve seen the Preamble. I\'m very happy to see that. Because there is no interpretation over that, why do we fight, what does it represent, let\'s write it down. That\'s the whole idea of a progressive society, right? Let us not work on somebody -- a philosopher king, let us write down how they will operate.\n\nAlso Read | The changing face of Dalit politics\n\nI want to know what did the Congress war room achieve? Because the Congress did not have a good structure in the Hindi belt. It is performed better, especially in some seats in Uttar Pradesh in an alliance. The numbers have gone up. Can you tell me what were you trying to achieve in the war room?\n\nI would not first of all, call it a war room because we are not doing any war there. We are trying to connect to a lot of cadre people. But this whole change in voting behaviour is not just about the connect centre, it is about leadership, it is about the narratives, the leaders.\n\nHow important is the booth management? That is where I always felt that the Congress was weak as compared to the RSS-BJP cadre.\n\nIt is important, but it alone cannot operate. You need a narrative and the organisation. That is when the organisation and narrative, along with the right communication, will actually influence voting behaviour. So it has to operate on an equal level. The Congress was weak in that space, and we tried to balance it this time.\n\nBut I also have to say this, that Lok Sabha elections are largely narrative elections. What is the narrative that the leader is going to give?\n\nSo, what was the narrative as you understood at this time?\n\nThis time we were very clear, at least Rahul ji was leading the narrative. And he had excellent clarity in what the narrative should be. And more than that, what it cannot become.\n\nWhat was it? Please tell us what you saw.\n\nSo the BJP had a narrative on the lines that we expected -- polarisation. That is the narrative they sell. They work on the fear in a voter\'s mind. That ""Ye hoga toh vo hojayega"" types. We wanted to go perpendicular, not at all parallel in any way to them. Perpendicular, dissecting the livelihood issues, dissecting employment, dissecting women\'s empowerment, and we proposed five guarantees -- everything affecting a family.\n\nI know the guarantees because you were part of it in Karnataka. I have seen those and you were happy, but the point is there has also been a lot of criticism that can they be afforded? Is the Karnataka government being able to pay its bills?\n\nYes, Karnataka is paying it, and we have thought over it. It is not being done without a thought process.\n\nI believe that the Prime Minister actually picked up the idea of ""Modi Ki Guarantee"" after the Karnataka election\'s ""Congress Ki Guarantee"". But it did not work, it boomeranged on them.\n\nLet us rewind. A year before he was calling it revadi. He was making fun of it, and then he took the word himself, as usual without any shame, and then used it as Modi Ki Guarantee. But the problem is he never told what that guarantee was.\n\nSo, you felt that it was the economic issues or was it the caste census? Or was it that he would take away reservation?\n\nThe primary line is the economic issues. Now, there is another line that BJP themselves had given in our hand, that they are not going to wait, they are going to change the Samvidhan [Constitution]. And then the whole idea of ""400 sau paar"". People could easily understand that these guys are going to do this. Now, they are giving a brand of majoritarian politics saying that ""Hum Hindu hai, hum Hindu ka he problem horahe"" [We are Hindu and these are the problems we face]. So, India is the only country where even this majoritarian line is fake. In other majoritarian countries, there is real majoritarianism.\n\nWhy is this fake?\n\nBecause, in other majoritarian countries, you have undue advantage for the majority and then the minority gets a very tough deal. Here in India, the majority itself gets a rough deal from the BJP and when I ask for caste census, who am I asking for? I am asking it for the Hindus. And the vast majority of the Hindus are going to get benefited out of that. Why wouldn\'t the BJP not want it?\n\nWhy do they not want it?\n\nBecause they care a damn about Hindu and Hinduism. They only use it as a tool to gain votes. In their hearts, they are casteists, and they are casteist people sitting on the higher echelons, trying to flummox the rest of the caste system to make [them] believe they have actually won.\n\nBut Narendra Modi is OBC.\n\nYeah, but he does not care about OBCs. He should have been fighting for the caste census, why is he not? So he is this opportunist who is just mil-ofied [collaborating] with the upper echelons and trying to utilise the whole fake narrative of Hinduism, Hindutva, to gain votes, that\'s all.\n\nAnd after they gain votes, their actual enemies are these OBCs, SCs, STs -- I do not think they have much to do with Muslims. They do that so that they get votes. But after that, they have been only destroying the lives of whatever affirmative action this category of Hinduism got. That is why I say India is the only country where Hinduism [and] this whole majoritarian politics is also a fake majoritarianism.'"
348,348,"b'On June 4, even as election results unfolded a changed political equation, Rahul Gandhi appeared in an intriguing place: the X account @archivedilfs. Expanding the acronym DILF may be more than this venerable journal can bring itself to do. For those who do not know, it stands for what some people might like to do to a Zaddy, or attractive older man, especially in the queer universe.\n\nThe tweet featured one of the videos from the Bharat Jodo Yatra where Rahul, backlit by a sunset, his wrinkles glowing in the golden hour, reaches out to people and people reach out for him. The video was cut to the song, ""Daddy\'s Back"".\n\nThis may not seem like a significant political event, but I would like to argue that Rahul Gandhi\'s journey from Pappu to DILF signals a turning point in not only his own evolution, but also in the evolving need for new political frames.\n\nAlthough Rahul is blessed with movie star good looks, he never seemed to acquire a star\'s stature, not even after perceptions of him altered with the Bharat Jodo Yatra. In December 2023, I wrote in this magazine about the very different masculinity Rahul embodies, one which provides an antidote to the more dominating and domineering version idealised over the last decade. This masculinity is softer, more embracing and caring. But I did end with the question of whether Rahul, for all his willingness to rise to the challenges of being on the losing side, could bring a more libidinal force to bear on his work and display a franker appetite for power.\n\nShedding self-consciousness\n\nThe last few weeks of the election campaign certainly showed us a Rahul possessed of an irreverent confidence which was mirrored in the energy and chutzpah of the Congress social media handles. What Rahul seemed to shed was a kind of self-consciousness that has shadowed him in the past. This was evident even in the interviews he did with YouTube channels such as Curly Tales and Unfiltered by Samdish during the Bharat Jodo Yatra, where he found it hard to respond fulsomely to everyday questions or humorous asides. He tended to fall back on logical-sounding, near-technical responses. He hesitated to expand on potent, culturally resonant ideas like tapasya even if he brought them up himself, as if that might sound overblown and dramatic. On questions from China to unemployment, he came across as a little too bookish and nerdy. Knowledgeable yes, but not compelling.\n\nIn other words, he was trapped in a political aesthetic particular to liberal elites. Or, to put it more bluntly, an upper caste masculine aesthetic, where the idea of the ""rational"" dominates as the indicator of superior intellect, one that is cool and distant and rooted in realist, hence legalistic, forms of argument and denouncement. Here, culture must fit political theory rather than yielding new forms of theorising and paths of action. The emotional, the sensory, and the popular are viewed with mild distaste, seen as excessive hence uncontrolled, unreliable, inferior forms.\n\nStudents wear Rahul face masks at his 54th birthday celebrations at Gandhi Bhawan in Hyderabad on June 19. | Photo Credit: Tharun Vinny/ ANI\n\nThrough the elections, Rahul seemed to slowly and steadily liberate himself from the last of this burden, which some might call the albatross of Lutyens\' Delhi. Over the course of his campaign, his images became gradually more cinematic, exceeding the boundaries of the social media frame. He was not merely transmitting decency and kindness, he was also willing to be a little rude about the other side, to make unambiguous promises, speak an emotive language, utilising every rasa available to a communicator: compassion, sarcasm, humour, assertion, and unabashed emotion.\n\nAlso Read | Rahul Gandhi in search of a Bidenesque solution\n\nLove ceased to be a politically pleasant concept and emboldened itself into an iconography of risk. Here was Rahul speaking in the rain. Here he was holding up the Constitution wherever he went. There he was with his family receiving women who brought gifts of ghee and asked his mother when she would arrange his marriage while children played with his dog. Here he was hugging his beloved sister and pulling her cheeks. There he was jumping a barrier to buy Mysore pak for ""my brother Stalin"". He promised every woman below the poverty line Rs.1 lakh a year. He ceased to speak about caste and inequality via bureaucratic concepts and began to speak of these things experientially and from a place of faith. As he did so, he communicated more strongly and differently across masses of people than he had in the past.\n\nAs he evolved, jauntier and more suggestive memes appeared. The journalist Amrita Madhukalya tweeted: ""GenZ twitter is so unserious, they have taken polls to a territory of innuendos and thirst traps"", while sharing a thread of said thirst traps. The emergence of Rahul as a ""thirst trap"", a person whose photographs elicit and feed sexual thirst, indicates something libidinal that is unbound in the public when they connect one-to-one with a person and via that persona with an ideological universe. Rahul became, as stars and leaders do, the personification of an idea.\n\nA selfie session during a ride in the Delhi Metro in May 2024. | Photo Credit: ANI\n\nBut the thirst that Rahul feeds is not merely a sexual one. We may more rightly describe it as eros. Plato defines eros as a ""good composer"" of every living thing, every work of art, every idea, ""because you cannot give someone else what you don\'t have or teach someone what you don\'t know yourself"". This eros, of humour and sexual-ness, of connection and co-creation, brought to the surface what had been subterranean and scattered. It is an eros of diverse aspirations, a definition of Indian-ness which has been invalidated by Hindutva, a re-centring of the poor made vulnerable by the development so beloved of elites, and a new, non-technocratic imagination which must be co-created, not handed down; something porous and fluid, not intact and hermetic.\n\nEmerging persona\n\nThrough this emerging persona we see Rahul remix several ideas. For one, he reframes the idea of family, as not only the location of inherited privilege but also one of affection, loss, and supportive bonds. He also reframes the idea of a single man as the remote patriarch, the lofty ascetic, to one who exists in a vast network of relationships, of family and extended community. There are his sister and mother. There are moonh-bole (stated) brothers (aka my brother Stalin). There are comrades and partners, like Akhilesh Yadav (the UP ke launde or Uttar Pradesh\'s lads). There is the respected older colleague, like Mallikarjun Kharge who holds Rahul\'s hand to cut a birthday cake and feeds him a slice. He reframes the idea of touch as being not just sexual, but comradely, comforting, collegial, as he reaches out to people of all ages and genders in gestures of connection. These images of togetherness are potent for a reason.\n\nThe dread of unemployment, the obstacles to education, the crushing inflation -- the sheer difficulty of life -- have left people feeling undefended and alone. This comes on the heels of a long cultural period whose pervasive motto has been each man for himself. Moreover, it follows a time when tragic events around the country have not been met with compassion by the ruling party. In fact, all events have been subsumed into the figure of Narendra Modi, and constantly used to bolster his image. We can think of Manipur, we can think of migrant workers on the long walk home in an abruptly announced lockdown, we can think of deaths due to COVID-19, and deaths due to communal hatred. Compassion, even acknowledgement, has been in short supply. Serving the people has become a long-forgotten formality. In a time of hypercapitalism, we inhabit a transactional culture, politically and personally, and it corrodes our lives, politically and personally.\n\nIn this world, which might be encapsulated in the Hindi phrase, ""Aisa koi saga nahin, jise humne thaga nahin"" (There\'s not one relation I did not dupe), Rahul dares to personify the idea of ""Sab mere sage hain"" (The world is my family).\n\nRahul comforts a woman during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in January 2024. | Photo Credit: ANI\n\nEqually, Rahul reframes the idea of the hero\'s journey -- a solitary sojourn to success. We do not see him emerge as a single or singular figure. His journey seems to exist amid other journeys, taken in tandem if not together. The images that emerge of the opposition victories in this election are heterogenous. We see Akhilesh Yadav and Uddhav Thackeray. We see the entry of Priyanka Gandhi, arguably the more charismatic and statesperson-like of the two, competition and collaboration at once. We see Geniben Thakor defeating the BJP in Gujarat. We see Sanjana Jatav dancing when she wins, or, as the X handle of ""The Dalit Voice"" put it with pithy beauty, ""One of the youngest Dalit women to become an MP is enjoying democracy.""\n\nIf the last decade saw a paradigm shift in the discourse of politics, where engagement and debate became impossible in the face of totalitarian domination, perhaps this heterogeneity and its accompanying federalism signal a new paradigm shift. If the voter was often seen passively in terms of identity rather than actively as making strategic choices, then in this new paradigm the voter too demands to be looked at and seen. As Revati Laul wrote in a news website, ""We are a country of subversives. Even when half of us conform and capitulate, we are in conversation with the half that does not. At various points in our lives as individuals and as a collective, each of us has conformed, capitulated, and then thrown it up in the air because that is who we innately are as a people. And it\'s hard to measure, hard to quantify, because by definition it means that most of the time an Indian will not tell you what she really thinks. You have to be very good at reading the subtext and at eking it out of her."" In the mixed results of this election is a conversation that India is having with itself -- perhaps an argument even. We cannot say Rahul has architected it, but for a number of reasons, he has come to symbolise it conceptually.\n\nReframing political success\n\nHow, then, should Rahul enjoy democracy?\n\nThe answer seems self-evident -- through trying to be Prime Minister. And yet, that answer is not so self-evident. Rahul\'s own seeming ambivalence on this matter has marked him as a dubious political proposition across the ideological spectrum.\n\nTamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.

The commentariat is always dissatisfied. Some suggest he should open a gym. Others complain that he brings up his personal losses and traumas too often. Another acknowledges that there have been some achievements but sets a report card for further progress to be made, or else.\n\nAlso Read | Rahul Gandhi, Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, and the power of walking\n\nBut maybe these reactions say something about how our relationship with politics has become somewhat literal, where winning is the only thing that validates a political idea. There is that fear that Rahul Gandhi is more winsome than winning. And that by liking or supporting him, we show ourselves to be foolish believers. Not rational or critical enough, merely driven by sentiment. Should he be defeated, we too will be humiliated.\n\nHence, we wait, always, for him to culminate in conventional success before we are willing to grant full approval. But what if a climax is not the journey Rahul proposes for himself, at least not quite yet? Rahul has repeatedly said that he sees this as an ideological fight. It has its electoral dimensions, but his journey seems to be primarily a philosophical one.\n\nPerhaps we might reframe how we see political success. What we see as Rahul\'s indecisiveness might also be seen as an open-endedness. Even while crafting a certain personal journey, he seems to generate the idea that multiple journeys might occur in cooperation, and iteratively.\n\nTransparency and sincerity\n\nOn June 19, Rahul celebrated his 54th birthday. He ended the day with a reel where he initialled his signature white T-shirt, one that updates the politician\'s garb of kurta to an unpretentious, modern, youthful, class-agnostic, and gender-neutral garment, open wide to interpretations.\n\nRahul gives Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge a piece of birthday cake in New Delhi on June 19. | Photo Credit: ANI\n\n""This T-shirt for me symbolizes transparency, simplicity, and perseverance. I am sure you have used these values and fought for these values in your life. Tell me how you have used them, and I\'ll send you a white T-shirt in response. Love you all,"" he tweeted. It was an offer of co-creation and allyship through a common, inclusive frame, a validation of people\'s own political journeys, and at the same time an acceptance of the ideological responsibility he has laid claim to.\n\nFor Rahul\'s growing following, this transparency and sincerity are real, and they respond to it with growing love, as if he were a favourite cousin. They express a passionate wish that he should be Prime Minister, but even as they do so, they qualify it with the idea that he stands for values they believe in and that they want to see embodied in the system. It is entirely possible that whoever else becomes Prime Minister, in the comradeship of Rahul, they would still earn the public\'s love.\n\nParomita Vohra is a filmmaker, writer, and dedicated Antakshari player.

349,349,"b""Meet Team India's New Batting Sensation Abhishek Sharma's Biggest Fan Komal Sharma - In Pics\n\nRahul Gandhi, in his new role as Leader Of the Opposition, may prove further detrimental to the BJP. In the last week, Rahul Gandhi has touched two vital nerves that have been unfavourable for the saffron party. The first was his meeting with the Railway loco pilots and the second was with the people of Manipur. Loco pilots have long been ignored by the BJP government and Rahul Gandhi's meeting with them have exposed the vulnerability that the railways is facing. While these are political optics, the recently concluded Lok Sabha poll results showed that these tricks are working for the Congress, a party that has faced unprecedented challenges since 2014.\n\nCongress bagged less than 60 seats in both the general elections of 2014 and 2019. However, realizing people's disconnect with the Congress, Rahul Gandhi embarked on a daring 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' and 'Nyay Yatra' while regularly interacting with the section of people who drive the economy at the bottom level - farmers, carpenters, mechanics, and now loco pilots. Even political analyst Prashant Kishor had laughed off Rahul Gandhi's photo-ops predicting that these won't make much difference. However, the 2024 result was out of the syllabus question even for the exit pollsters. While the Congress secured just 99 seats, the almost 200% rise in the party's seats can be credited to multiple factors including Rahul Gandhi's ground outreach.\n\nAhead of the general elections, Rahul Gandhi met all those sections which are aggrieved and were protesting against the establishment - be it farmers or wrestlers or people from Manipur. The impact was very much visible in the Lok Sabha polls results where the Congress swept the Manipur elections snatching both seats from the NDA while it significantly dented the BJP's prospects in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.\n\nSince the Manipur crisis began a year ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not visited the state even once while Rahul visited the state and met people thrice. His visits may not have made much difference, but it certainly gave a message that Congress is with the people in times of crisis. His meetings with farmers or protesting wrestlers sent out a similar message to the concerned group and voters. In Haryana, the BJP lost five seats to Congress while in Rajasthan, it lost 11 and suffered a massive setback in Uttar Pradesh conceding 28 seats to the SP-Congress alliance.\n\nThe BJP's internal reports have highlighted that its leaders' disconnect with the public and party workers played a key role in bringing down the party's tally below the majority mark. The BJP was earlier known as a party which always remains in election mode but it seems that Rahul Gandhi has now decided to remain in the election mode until Congress returns to power. From raising the NEET issue to visiting Assam and Manipur, Rahul Gandhi has shown that the road ahead is not smooth for the BJP.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the BJP leaders are yet to come out of the delusion and hit the ground. It's high time that BJP leaders including Narendra Modi get down to the ground, meeting people and resolving their grievances, else the next elections might see a role reversal between the BJP and the Congress."""

The two parallel yatras, led by former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Congress General Secretary Kumari Selja, have once again sharpened the factional fault lines in the grand old party.\n\nKumari Selja and Bhupinder Singh Hooda announced their padyatras (foot marches) on July 7 and July 11, respectively. While announcing the padyatra, Selja said she would focus on the state\'s urban areas.\n\n""The ruling BJP gained an edge over the Congress in 44 urban assembly constituencies. There is a need to strengthen the party in urban Haryana. The planning of this yatra is underway. The motive of the padyatra is to expose the BJP\'s anti-people decisions. The yatra route and the date will be announced soon,"" Kumari Selja said.\n\nFour days after Selja\'s announcement, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Haryana Congress chief Uday Bhan, and state in-charge Deepak Babaria jointly announced the \'Haryana Mange Hisab\' yatra in Chandigarh on July 11. The yatra, led by Deepender Singh Hooda, was flagged off on July 15 by Uday Bhan.\n\nThe \'Haryana Mange Hisab\' yatra will cover nearly a dozen assembly constituencies in the first phase. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi are expected to join the yatra near the election. The motive of this yatra is to corner the ruling BJP on various issues, including inflation, unemployment, and law and order.\n\nBhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Uday Bhan will also hold a \'rath yatra\' (chariot march) from August 20 onwards, immediately after Deepender Hooda concludes his yatra.\n\nWhile Selja\'s Padyatra has no party backing so far, the yatras led by Deepender Hooda and Bhupinder Hooda will be a precursor to the main campaign, which will be launched by senior party leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi near the assembly election.\n\nInterestingly, the Congress planned the yatras to expose the BJP government\'s failure to control unemployment, inflation, and law and order but exposed itself. Despite clear directions from the Congress high command that the state leaders should present a united front, the rival Haryana Congress factions are holding parallel yatras to assert themselves.\n\nKumari Selja\'s padyatra is being viewed as an attempt to create a parallel power centre in the Haryana Congress ahead of Assembly polls. Many of her supporters favour her as the chief ministerial candidate. The Hooda camp has already pitched Bhupinder Singh Hooda as the pre-poll chief ministerial candidate.\n\nHooda and Uday Bhan, along with the state party affairs in-charge Deepak Babaria, are seen together, which has fumed the opposition faction. Kumari Selja has accused Deepak Babaria of being inclined toward the Bhupinder Singh Hooda camp and ignoring the other leaders.\n\nNotably, this is not the first time that anti-Hooda camp leaders have held a parallel yatra to show strength. In January this year, the then SRK group (Kumari Selja, Randeep Singh Surjewala, and Kiran Choudhary) had also brought Congress Sandesh yatra to Hisar to counter Bhupinder Singh Hooda\'s \'Ghar Ghar Congress\' campaign.\n\nFormer Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Chandra Mohan Singh even addressed Kumari Selja as the next chief minister of the state.\n\nBoth factions aimed to strengthen Rahul Gandhi\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra, but the parallel yatras brought the fissures within the party organisation to the fore. The Congress general secretary in-charge, Deepak Babaria, even appealed to the party workers to make the \'Ghar Ghar Congress\' campaign a success.\n\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah, who addressed a rally in Mahendergarh on July 16, mocked the Congress on its \'Haryana Mange Hisab\' yatra.\n\n""Congress didn\'t do anything in the name of development. Hooda sahab, why should we keep the debit? I have come up with the account and challenge you. Go to the people with your ten-year account and compare it with our governance. I am the son of a trader and will share every bit. You gave only Rs 4,100 crore, and the BJP government spent Rs 2,59,000 crore, which is six times higher,"" Amit Shah said.\n\nReacting to the parallel yatras, BJP spokesperson Praveen Attrey said that bringing all Congress leaders together was like ""collecting frogs in a bucket"".\n\n""Kumari Selja and Bhupinder Singh Hooda have drawn daggers to get themselves announced as the pre-poll chief ministerial candidates. Internal feuds will be responsible for the party\'s shameful drubbing in the 2024 elections,"" Praveen Attrey said.'"

Even though the Trinamool understands that the LoP would be from the Congress as it is the single-largest party, the Mamata Banerjee-led party made its stand clear on the issue of the Speaker election in Lok Sabha, stating that they were not consulted on the matter. Sources in the Trinamool said there was never any conflict over the post of the LoP as that would not benefit the party.\n\nSamajwadi Party: The Samajwadi Party, a major alliance partner of the INDIA bloc in Uttar Pradesh, is expected to reap big gains with Rahul Gandhi as the leader of the Opposition. The Samajwadi Party can use Rahul Gandhi\'s position to mount pressure on the government. Rahul Gandhi, leading the Opposition, will also be taken as UP\'s opposition face against PM Modi. Similarly, Akhilesh Yadav, who earlier was the leader of the opposition in the UP Assembly, has been dominant and is now expected to heat up the Parliamentary session. His presence along with Rahul Gandhi will also strengthen the alliance in the state and will have political implications.\n\nDMK: The elevation of Rahul Gandhi as the leader of the Opposition holds major significance for the DMK government in Tamil Nadu, which was also part of the INDI Alliance. The party had no objection to the move and this was made clear with Chief Minister MK Stalin\'s X post showing a picture of him hugging Rahul Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra with the message, ""India welcomes my brother Rahul Gandhi to his new role. May his voice continue to roar strongly in the House of the People"".\n\nRJD: The RJD has claimed that Rahul Gandhi taking up the post will have a positive impact on the state ahead of the crucial assembly elections scheduled to be held next year. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said, ""Now that Rahul Gandhi has become the leader of the opposition it will have a big impact in the state as both Rahul and Tejashwi Yadav will defeat the NDA in elections next year"". Tiwari said that how Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav contested Lok Sabha elections in Bihar on core issues made it very difficult for the BJP to gain ground in various parts of the country.\n\nMVA: With Rahul Gandhi taking the centre stage as the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, issues like the stand against Savarkar and Adani\'s Dharavi redevelopment project, on which Rahul Gandhi was aggressive, can become a bone of contention with the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP. Maharashtra Congress state president Nana Patole said the party has become the \'big brother\' in the state alliance and aiming to contest 150 out of 288 seats. This has already sparked a row in the alliance. This has made the seat-sharing pact challenging for all three constituent parties of MVA ahead of the state elections.'"

358,358,"b'It is on Hindu society to push back against the false claims, hate speech and violence unleased of the Sangh Parivar.\n\nAs a Hindu, I can totally relate to Rahul Gandhi\'s anguish expressed in his inaugural speech in Parliament on July 1 that some of those who engage in violence and are guilty of hate speech are proudly calling themselves Hindu. I too am greatly troubled by the Sangh Parivar\'s frequent claim to be speaking for all Hindus. They most certainly do not.\n\nClearly, Gandhi was addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha when he accused them of not being real Hindus, as they ""did not stand with the truth"". No one heard him accuse the entire Hindu society of being violent, until Prime Minister Narendra Modi falsely claimed that he had.\n\nThe truth is that anyone who has been paying attention to Gandhi\'s speeches, or has watched his empathetic interactions with people from all walks of India during his Bharat Jodo Yatra, know exactly what he meant in his speech: Too much hate and violence has been let loose by the BJP and its ideological siblings in the name of all Hindus.\n\nThere was no better vindication of what Gandhi had just said about BJP\'s uneasy relationship with the truth than Modi\'s blatant twisting of his words to claim that he was vilifying all Hindus.\n\nBut then, Modi is a master at the art of twisting facts. When he was chief minister of Gujarat, Modi used to incite crowds during poll campaigns by falsely declaring that his critics were defaming five crore Gujaratis. The fact that no one was blaming all Gujaratis for the 2002 violence seemed to matter little. Repeated often enough, Modi\'s fictional narrative stuck all the way to his ascent in Delhi.\n\nAuthor and activist Mukul Dube wrote at the time in The Path of the Parivar: Articles on Gujarat and Hindutva:\n\n""The genius of the \'honour of Gujarat\' argument is that it deftly places the ordinary, peaceable Hindus of the state into the same logical category as the monsters who committed unspeakable crimes and their instigators...The guilt of a relatively small pack of criminals is spread widely and thereby dissipated. People who would never dream of killing or raping other humans, are told in perfervid language that they have been accused of just these violations - and believing this, they react with outrage.""\n\nModi\'s reaction to Gandhi\'s Parliament speech, in my view, was a carbon copy of his Gujarat strategy: make every Hindu feel personally attacked by the opposition parties - in this case, by Gandhi - by whatever means necessary.\n\nAll that aside, a man who just a few weeks back had labeled all 200 million Muslims as infiltrators has no moral credibility to complain that Gandhi was negatively stereotyping all Hindus.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah was quick to double down on Modi\'s accusation: ""The Leader of Opposition has categorically said that those who call themselves Hindu talk of violence and do violence. He doesn\'t know that crores of people proudly call themselves Hindu. Connecting violence with any religion is wrong. He should apologise.""\n\nWho can disagree with the sentiment that ""connecting violence with any religion is wrong""? However, when such a noble thought comes from the lips of a person known for his notorious record of hate speech against Muslims, it strains credulity.\n\nBut then, Shah has had no compunctions about promoting disinformation. Five years ago, he gave a pep talkBJP\'s ""IT Cell"", as the party\'s propaganda unit is called, admiring their skill in making all sorts of messages go viral: ""We are capable of delivering any message we want to the public, whether sweet or sour, true or fake.""\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was one of the first to share a misleading clipped video of Gandhi\'s speech, tripling down on Modi\'s false claim that Rahul had labeled all Hindus as violent: ""Sheer audacity of LoP @RahulGandhi to call everyone who calls himself Hindu as ""hinsak""/violent shows @INCIndia\'s hatred and contempt towards Hindus...""\n\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath\'s response to Rahul was pure hyperbole: ""Hindu is synonymous with tolerance, generosity and gratitude. We are proud that we are Hindus!...You should apologise to crores of Hindus of the world Rahul ji! Today you have not hurt a community but the soul of Mother India.""\n\nTolerance and generosity are not exactly virtues for which Adityanath is known. His actions against Muslims, including bulldozing homes without any due process, have come to epitomise the worst of India today. I am embarrassed that he wears the saffron garments of a Hindu monk even as he leads the politics of ""Muslim effacement"" in his state.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was not too far behind the others in the chorus of Amens to Modi\'s false charge against Rahul: ""This is now the Leader of Opposition. Who attacks Hindus while professing brotherhood to all...""\n\nIn the event, it\'s the height of hypocrisy to demand that Rahul apologise for something he did not say in his Parliament speech. If there is anyone who needs to apologise to all Hindus for deliberately twisting Gandhi\'s words, and causing violence in some parts of the country, they are the BJP luminaries who unquestioningly followed the prime minister in abusing the Congress leader.\n\nThere were times when Indians in the diaspora were mere spectators and admirers of Indian democracy at work. But that changed as soon as the BJP began to co-opt the Hindu faith in its political goals. Since then, Indians in the diaspora, especially Hindus, have become unwitting stakeholders in Indian politics, with the right and the responsibility to call out the misdeeds of Modi\'s Hindutva government and to loudly say, ""Not in Our Names!""\n\nNo one could have said it better than Congress parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor, who strongly pushed back on the ""presumption that the purveyors of hatred speak for all or even most Hindus"":\n\n""To discriminate against another, to attack another, to kill another, to destroy another\'s place of worship, is not part of the Hindu dharma so magnificently preached by Vivekananda, nor the Hinduism propagated in twentieth-century India by Mahatma Gandhi, whose advocacy of ahimsa and satyagraha brought Hindu values into the national movement, while accommodating all other faiths...The Hindutva ideology is in fact a malign distortion of Hinduism.""\n\nViews expressed are entirely personal.'"
359,359,"b'The Narmada Bachao Andolan activist faces a jail term for defaming the man who once tried to vilify a mass movement for questioning the Indian state.\n\nA court in New Delhi on Monday sentenced Medha Patkar to a five-month jail term. This is in a defamation case filed in 2000 by VK Saxena, who is now lieutenant governor of Delhi.\n\nI read this news and my mind rolled all the way back to 10 November of 2000. That day, the Indian Express carried a large advertisement on page five, an ad that has an intimate connection to this defamation case.\n\nI wrote about that ad in my book The Narmada Dammed (Penguin, 2002). What follows is the relevant excerpt from the book, lightly edited:\n\nSomeone I will call Mr X, President of the ""National Council for Civil Liberties"" of Ahmedabad, was responsible for the ad. ""True face of Ms Medha Patkar and her NBA"" or Narmada Bachao Andolan, it proclaimed. It presented to credulous readers two facets of this ""true face"".\n\nThe first: ""NBA is passing on confidential documents related to projects of national importance to the [sic] foreign people."" Reading those words, you were meant to bristle with righteous rage at the Narmada Bachao Andolan good-for-nothings who would pass national secrets to foreigners. The ""proof""? An ""e-mail message"" from ""Ms Chitra Rupa Palit of NBA"", to two Swiss gentlemen, reproduced immediately below.\n\nThe sender\'s name, as written on that very ""e-mail message"", is ""Chittaroopa"", not ""Chitra Rupa"", but let\'s gloss over that little detail. Just what did Ms Palit, an Narmada Bachao Andolan activist from Madhya Pradesh, write to the Swiss gentlemen? This dangerous admission: ""I am enclosing the (confidential) Risk analysis document that we have prepared."" [Emphasis added].\n\nThat is, Ms Palit is referring to a document the Narmada Bachao Andolan had itself produced. How that qualifies as a national secret, Mr X and the National Council for Civil Liberties do not explain. And why should they explain? Their purpose has been served. They have painted the Narmada Bachao Andolan as treasonous in your eyes. You, who saw the ad, were not meant to actually read Ms Palit\'s ""e-mail message"".\n\nThe second: the Narmada Bachao Andolan supports itself ""through hawala transactions"". Hawala, as we once know well, refers to undeclared transactions in foreign exchange, on foreign soil. And what\'s the proof this time? A letter from a Nashik organisation called Lok Samiti to a company, thanking the company for its donation of some thousands of rupees. (A second inference you are supposed to make is that Lok Samiti is a mere front for the Narmada Bachao Andolan, allowing the Andolan to collect funds on the quiet.)\n\nBut the third line - yes, the third line - in that letter mentions the Narmada Bachao Andolan, explicitly saying that the funds are for the Narmada Bachao Andolan. In what sense, then, is the Narmada Bachao Andolan taking these funds on the quiet? Besides, Lok Samiti is an Indian organisation, in an Indian city, taking Indian rupees, issuing an Indian receipt, and handing the rupees over to another Indian organisation. In what sense is this a transaction in another country involving undeclared foreign currency, ie a ""hawala transaction""?\n\nYet why should Mr X and the National Council for Civil Liberties care about answering those questions? They have put the idea of a hawala-tainted Narmada Bachao Andolan in your mind, have they not? Their purpose, served again. No, you were not meant to actually read the ad.\n\nPerhaps most telling of all is a line at the bottom of the ad. ""Space donated by a Patriot"", it says.\n\nIt makes me wonder. If patriots must seek to win public favour this way, we have slid a long way indeed from the times of Azad and Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. Someone save us from bumbling patriots.\n\nBut ordinarily, this ad may not have been particularly worth noticing. After all, over the years many people have made accusations about the Narmada Bachao Andolan and its activists. Besides, if a private organisation makes such comments, what does that have to do with the government?\n\nThere\'s a reason to ask that. Because just months later, there was a follow-up to this ad that brought everything together.\n\nThe very same National Council for Civil Liberties submitted a memorandum to Home Minister LK Advani. It asked him to ban the Narmada Bachao Andolan under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1957. An entire raft of politicians signed the memorandum to support the National Council for Civil Liberties demand: then Gujarat heavyweights Amarsinh Choudhary, Shankarsinh Vaghela, Dilip Parikh, Chhabildas Mehta and Suresh Mehta, Madhya Pradesh\'s then Deputy Chief Minister Jamuna Devi and the then president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, Radhakishan Malviya.\n\nAs Ashish Kothari wrote in Frontline:\n\n""The memorandum...was reportedly submitted with details of NBA alleged subversive activities: foreign funding, passing on confidential reports related to important projects of the country to foreign agencies, human rights violations in the Narmada Valley, evasion of income tax, and letting loose a reign of violence against the project-affected persons and even government officials engaged in survey and rehabilitation work in the valley. NCCL president [Mr X] was also quoted as threatening to move the High Court if the Central government delayed imposing the ban on the NBA.""\n\nAs you can see, Mr X remained confident that nobody had actually read his ad and so discovered how hollow were his allegations about foreign funding and passing on secrets.\n\nI don\'t intend to mount here a detailed defense of the Narmada Bachao Andolan against this memorandum. Still, this ties right in with the ""Space donated by a Patriot"" line at the bottom of the ad. The whole demand for a ban implies that disagreeing with the state is not just an unlawful activity that must be prevented, it is also traitorous. Again as Kothari writes:\n\n""There is an unwritten assumption that the state can do no wrong, and that anything it does must be in the \'national\' interest. Such faith in the Indian state is indeed touching. If the interests of those behind such demands were not clear, one would even be driven to tears by such blind faith.""\n\nTruly: if our experience of over seven decades tells us anything, it is that the state can indeed do wrong.

360,360,"b'The emphasis on direct, personalised interactions comes from him having tasted success with this approach, say party insiders and political commentators.\n\nSince he took on the mantle of leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been constantly on the move.\n\nOn July 5, two days after the opening session of Parliament ended, he travelled to Uttar Pradesh to meet the families of the victims of the Hathras stampede in which 120 people, mostly women, had died.\n\nEarlier, on the same day, Gandhi met a group of loco pilots at the New Delhi railway station. His social media post drawing attention to their working conditions elicited a sharp rebuttal from the Union railways minister, but on the ground, union leaders claimed officials met them and heard their grievances.\n\nThe next day, on July 6, he was in another state ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, meeting the families of those killed in the Rajkot fire tragedy. Days after his visit, the chief minister met the families for the first time.\n\nOn July 8, Gandhi was in Manipur, visiting relief camps in Jiribam, the latest site of ethnic strife in the state where 219 people have been killed since May last year.\n\nEarlier this month, in his first speech in the Lok Sabha as Leader of the Opposition, Gandhi had castigated the prime minister for not visiting Manipur even once. A day later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first major remarks on Manipur in Parliament.\n\nGandhi\'s speech also forced the government and the Indian Army to disclose how much compensation had been paid to the family of an Agniveer soldier. He had met the family of the slain soldier in Punjab in January.\n\nOnce dismissed as a part-time politician, Gandhi now appears to be constantly in campaign mode. His trips are making headlines, setting the narrative, and even forcing the government to respond.\n\nJournalist Neerja Chowdhury said three factors were discernible in Gandhi\'s strategy: ""A human, emotional outreach, being combative against the government on the floor of the House, and making himself accessible for his party members.""\n\nPolitical commentators are not surprised by Gandhi\'s emphasis on travel and direct, personalised interactions with people.\n\n""Reaching out to people is something that has given him traction,"" Chowdhury observed. ""Putting an arm around somebody, picking up a child, talking to an old woman, these are the things that resonated with people during the Bharat Jodo Yatra.""\n\nThe Bharat Jodo Yatra was a cross-country rally, during which Gandhi travelled over 3,000 kilometres, mostly on foot, from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu to Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir between September 2022 and January 2023. A second leg of the yatra saw Gandhi travel from Imphal in Manipur to Mumbai, mostly in a bus, between January and March.\n\nSupriya Shrinate, who heads Congress party\'s social media and digital platforms wing, told Scroll that the two Bharat Jodo Yatras have shaped the party\'s outreach strategy considerably.\n\n""The success of the Yatras proved to be a lesson for our party that we need to speak directly to the people,"" she said.\n\nAs part of this approach, on July 2, Gandhi publicised a new email address where people could contact him directly. In his tweet announcing the email address, Gandhi wrote: ""I am here to speak with you, listen to you, and facilitate the true expression of the idea of India"".\n\nCongress Working Committee member Salman Khurshid told Scroll that the government\'s responses on the matters raised by Gandhi validated the success of an ""alternative style of politics"".\n\n""The media and political commentators have a set script of how politics should be done,"" Khurshid said. ""Rahul Gandhi\'s style has always been different.""\n\nPraveen Chakravarty, chairman of the Congress\' data analytics wing, said that Gandhi\'s style of reaching out to people set him apart from Modi. ""How many times have you seen Modi going to common people\'s homes and hugging them and listening to them?""\n\nThe personalised style apart, what is the substance in Gandhi\'s outreach?\n\nJournalist Ajaz Ashraf pointed out that Gandhi\'s interactions are aimed at the same sections of the population that the Congress sought to win over during the elections.\n\n""The people he met in Hathras are poor Dalits,"" he said. ""The families of Agniveer jawans are again poor who have lost a young earning member.""\n\nAshraf described Gandhi\'s politics as that of the ""Hindu left"" in that it seeks to ""flatten caste hierarchy and distribute political, economic and cultural powers equitably, but at the same time presumes that you are a believer"".\n\nThis explains why Gandhi held up an image of the Hindu deity Shiva in Parliament, Ashraf said, even as he has been raising demands like conducting a caste census and filing up government job vacancies.\n\nHowever, one community has been missing from Gandhi\'s outreach. Journalist Rashid Kidwai pointed out Gandhi has not visited a single Muslim family despite 10 cases of lynchings targeting Muslims being reported in a month.\n\n""Is the Congress ready to come out on the streets and protect the Muslims?"" Kidwai asked. ""I do not see that happening. You cannot take a community for granted after it has voted heavily in favour of you.""\n\nSince the time of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi\'s outreach on the ground is accompanied by a substantial social media push. The effort has gradually led to an image makeover for the leader.\n\nMeghnad S, a journalist on YouTube who tracks media and politics, said that in the past, the BJP had successfully targeted Gandhi using pejorative nicknames ""pappu"" (incompetent) and ""shahzada"" (prince). But, during the recent Parliament session, Modi\'s attempt to characterise the Leader of the Opposition as ""baalak buddhi"", or a juvenile mind, largely failed. ""The prime minister mentioned the word so many times and tried to pin that image of Rahul Gandhi, but it has not stuck,"" said Meghnad.\n\nMeghnad also pointed out that Gandhi\'s speech in the Lok Sabha had several times more views than that of Modi on the YouTube channel of the government-run Sansad TV, which broadcasts proceedings of both houses of Parliament.\n\nBut the coverage on television news channels continues to be tilted in favour of the government, he said. ""There are some stray examples, like Aaj Tak recently took down a ticker alluding that Gandhi was \'doing drama\' in Manipur, after a Congress spokesperson took it up with an anchor on a live show, but I do not see much of a change,"" Meghnad said.\n\nShrinate said she was not worried about mainstream news channels, claiming that they had lost credibility and relevance. ""Rahul Gandhi has made news channels irrelevant by not giving them a single interview during the election campaign,"" she said.\n\nBut improved optics might not be enough if the Opposition wants to make a serious dent in the ruling party\'s prospects, commentators say.\n\nKidwai said that as Leader of the Opposition, Gandhi must also work on forging greater cohesion among alliance partners of the INDIA bloc, especially in the lead up to state elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand later this year.\n\n""The leader of the Opposition is seen as the shadow prime minister,"" he said. By involving leaders of other parties like Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress, Gandhi should try and ""form a shadow Cabinet"".\n\n""It should not seem like he is running a one-man show,"" Kidwai said. ""That is not good optics for an alliance.""\n\nAshraf also said that the Congress party should calibrate its strategy when it comes to Gandhi\'s interactions with people in states where alliance partners of the INDIA bloc are stronger.\n\n""In states like Maharashtra, Jharkhand, West Bengal or Uttar Pradesh, Congress will have to be careful about not trying to be too expansive, and rather give space to its allies,"" he said. ""The alliance partners should not feel threatened by Rahul Gandhi\'s actions. Because if the alliance breaks, Congress will lose its bulwark against the BJP.""'"

The honour comprises a purse of Rs 1 lakh and a sculpture designed by renowned artist and filmmaker Nemom Pushparaj.\n\nGandhi was a national leader who had listened to the problems of people and found solutions to them by conducting Bharat Jodo Yatra, a statement said.

He entered politics through student-youth movements and maintained a warm relationship with Kerala, especially Puthuppally. It was that affinity that made him different,"" Vijayan said.\n\nThe Left leader said that when he himself became the chief minister in 2016, the first person he met was Oommen Chandy, who was the outgoing CM.\n\n""Public service has been an integral part of his life.

364,364,"b'VIJAYAWADA : The Congress on Monday celebrated the 75th birth anniversary of YS Rajasekhara Reddy, the former Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh, in an unprecedented manner.\n\nTo mark the occasion, Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, released a video, highlighting YSR\'s contributions to the grand old party.\n\nIn his message, Rahul described YSR as the true leader of the masses. ""He was a person who believed in the people of Andhra Pradesh and lived for them. It\'s a tragedy we lost him. I am absolutely certain that had he been here today, Andhra Pradesh would have been a completely different place and it would not have the tragedies and difficulties it is facing today,"" the Congress leader said and exuded confidence that YSR\'s daughter YS Sharmila will take forward his legacy. Rahul also recalled that it was YSR\'s padayatra that inspired him to take up the Bharat Jodo Yatra.\n\nLater in the day, a host of Congress leaders from Telangana, where the party had emerged victorious in the Assembly elections, attended a programme in Mangalagiri. Telangana Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy, Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, and APCC chief YS Sharmila among others were present.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Revanth said he was representing Rahul Gandhi at the programme. Further, he asserted that the Congress will form government at the Centre as well as in Andhra Pradesh in 2029. ""Rahul Gandhi will become the Prime Minster of India and YS Sharmila will become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh,"" he declared.\n\nHe added, ""I take inspiration from YSR while conducting myself in the House and while encouraging newly-elected members to speak about public issues.""\n\nThose who uphold ideals of YSR are his true heirs, says Revanth\n\nFlagging the \'behind-the-scenes\' deals between the YSRC and the BJP, Revanth described Sharmila as the true inheritor of YSR\'s legacy. He said, ""Those who uphold the ideals of YSR are his true heirs and not those who use his name for doing \'political business\'.""\n\nStating that it is the BJP which has control over Andhra Pradesh, he said, ""BJP stands for Babu, Jagan and Pawan."" Observing that there is no opposition in the State, the Telangana Chief Minister said Sharmila will take up the role of the Opposition leader and become the voice of the people. ""She will fight for the people and State\'s rights,"" he averred.\n\nFurther, he said he brought his entire Cabinet for YSR Jayanthi celebrations to prove that they all are behind Sharmila.\n\nNoting that there is a \'talk\' about by-election for Kadapa Lok Sabha seat, the Telangana Chief Minister said, ""If the rumour turns out to be true, I will personally campaign for Sharmila so that the Lok Sabha can witness the valour of Kadapa. I will carry the flag of Congress to see to it that the party gets back what it lost in Kadapa."" The celebration of YSR\'s birth anniversary assumes significance in the wake of the drubbing that YS Jagan Mohan Reddy\'s YSRC suffered in the recent elections. The Congress is now eyeing to claim the YSR legacy with the former Chief Minister\'s daughter YS Sharmila Reddy at the helm of affairs in the State.\n\nDuring separate programmes held in Hyderabad to mark YSR\'s 75th birth anniversary, both Revanth Reddy and Bhatti Vikramarka gave a clarion call to the leaders who switched to the YSRC from the Congress to return to the fold of the grand old party.\n\nAddressing the gathering, APCC chief Sharmila recalled the moments she shared with her father before his sudden demise. ""He constantly thought about the people. He was most concerned for their welfare. His goal in life was to ensure completion of Jalayagnam in Andhra Pradesh. His last wish was to see Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister,"" she said.\n\nDescribing him as an unparalleled leader, Sharmila said, ""YSR was always against the BJP. He had described the saffron party as communal and opportunistic. He always believed that Congress should be in power to ensure the integrity and security of the nation.""'"
365,365,"b'A picture is worth a thousand words. A photograph is worth a powerful phrase: rigorous reinvention. The snapshot in question is a mise-en-sc\xc3\xa8ne of political theatre: the new Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi shaking hands with Speaker Om Birla, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju stand behind him. Modi and Rahul together had escorted Birla to the Speaker\'s chair -- a convention followed since 1950, though there is nothing conventional about either leader.\n\nSo, do the tea leaves foretell the return of Gandhi? It took over two decades in politics for Rahul to make it to the front bench of the opposition. The Bharat Jodo Yatra tee and chinos were gone. Rahul wore a formal, white kurta-pyjama on Day One of the new Lok Sabha. DNA matters -- father Rajiv Gandhi and mother Sonia were also LoPs, the latter for almost five years during the Vajpayee government.\n\nRahul will have a full entourage and Cabinet minister\'s rank. He gets a fully-furnished office in the parliament building. He will be assisted by a phalanx of personal staff including a private secretary. He will be on numerous statutory panels that select the Lok Pal, CBI director, vigilance commissioners, information commissioners and election commissioners. He has the privilege of initiating any debate and responding to the PM\'s speeches. Like his mother did in 2004, maybe he listened to his inner voice by accepting and not rejecting: ""It doesn\'t matter how much wisdom you have. If you don\'t have a position, you have nothing. That\'s the tragedy of India.""\n\nOnce, this entitled dynast treated parliament as a bagatelle -- over two decades of being an MP, just 99 questions, participation in 26 debates, and an attendance record thinner than his own party MPs\'. Rahul has mostly been AWOL at budget sessions since 2014, limiting himself to sudden dramatic Zorro-like appearances. The Congress failed to KO Modi because RaGa\'s nominees were ineffective. This time, the dynasty boy must become his party\'s buoy in the turbulent waters of parliamentary debate to take on Modi\'s guile. Will Rahul, like Alaric, become a hero of his people, or a royal wastrel like Bonnie Prince Charlie? Rahul\'s attitude and aptitude will determine his altitude in politics.\n\nThe Congress can\'t grab power on its own. It has not won a simple majority since 1984, when Rajiv won 404 seats. After wandering in the political desert for almost eight years, the Congress defeated the BJP in 2004. The credit goes to Sonia Gandhi; again in 2009, when she led her party to cross the 200 mark. Year 2014 was its Waterloo: just 44 MPs. In 2019, it was up a few notches at 52. Modi decisively decimated the Congress by targeting the Gandhis more than their party.\n\nRahul must invent a toolkit for the next Gandhi era. He needs the skills of Arjuna and the wiles of Shakuni to bring the bunch of ideologically disparate and ambitious allies to support his cause. He has the advantage of age and social acceptability. All INDIA leaders are age-wise, socially and economically compatible. Akhilesh Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav, Supriya Sule, Kanimozhi, Omar Abdullah, Abhishek Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and Aaditya Thackerey are Rahul\'s natural allies. DMK and RJD have declared Rahul their PM choice. However, each has their own turf to protect and expand. Rahul\'s advantage is that the Congress doesn\'t have much at stake in many states. He can afford to accept their dominance and make a tactical retreat in the short run. Sonia brought the Congress to power in 2004 by reconciling with former critic Sharad Pawar and giving plum portfolios to UPA allies. There is a lesson there.\n\nRahul\'s major political perturbation will be to blunt Modi\'s mettle in the Lok Sabha. Rahul isn\'t a forceful speaker. He must master the art of finding faults in Modipolitics, Modinomics and Modiplomacy. Modi has run both state and central governments like an unchallenged monarch. His popularity prevents him from diluting his mantra. Since he has to pander to the avaricious demands of allies, he may either succumb or falter. Rahul can grab that crucial moment and can beat Modi only with substance, not style.\n\nAs the LoP, he would have to meet Modi word for word, argument by argument, with a narrative that transcends rhetoric. He will need a mainframe of expert researchers and advisors to brief him on economics, politics, government management, defence, foreign relations and the environment. He needs spin doctors and oration to teach him how to effectively deliver counter-narratives. Is Rahul\'s untested ideology in sync with grandfather Nehru\'s? Going by his parliament questions and public speeches on social sectors, it seems he has inherited the Fabian socialist gene. The \'Two Indias\' trope is Rahul\'s idea borrowed from Nehru. Modi\'s strength comprises mesmerising slogans, big numbers and vertiginous targets. Since both of them would be in a confrontationist mood on a daily basis, Rahul must acquire new political and elocution skills to confront Modi on his own ground.\n\nEvery Gandhi built their own new Congress. Nehru inherited a party overawed by his popular persona and Mahatma Gandhi\'s benediction. Indira split the Congress and created a Praetorian guard wearing dry-cleaned homespun; some of them became chief ministers and Union ministers. She wasn\'t eventually insecure because she was bigger than the party. Now Sonia has bequeathed it to her children.\n\n""Often, as I wandered from meeting to meeting, I spoke to my audience of this India of ours, of Hindustan and of Bharata,"" writes Nehru in The Discovery of India. The Gandhi family\'s discovery of India is continuity through tragedy: Rajiv\'s premiership was the by-product of Sanjay\'s death followed by his mother\'s. As the Bofors scandal escalated, Rajiv favourites moved to the BJP, which enticed them with cabinet berths and MP seats. Ironically, most of them were siblings of Congress leaders, and like Rahul, were to the manor born. With Sonia\'s tactical retreat, Rahul must keep the Congress together and turn it into a battle-ready army. Unlike the BJP, whose mid-level state leadership is still learning the ropes, many Congress leaders are young or just middle-aged, while a few are only in their early sixties. A combo of Sachin Pilot, Revanth Reddy, D K Shivakumar, Gaurav Gogoi, Nana Patole, Deepender Hooda, Shashi Tharoor, Bhupesh Baghel et al can individually and collectively deliver electoral success in their regions.\n\nIn January 2013, Rahul told reporters in Jaipur: ""[The Congress] is a funny party. It is the largest political organisation in the world, but perhaps does not have a single rule or regulation. We create new rules every two minutes and then dump them. Nobody knows the rules in the party."" There is only one rule Rahul must follow: channel the lost Gandhi magic. He is just a step away from becoming the next prime minister. His transformation from Pappu to LoP became credible because of his two yatras. Gandhi 5.0 must remember that his cannot be a Congress of the Gandhis, by the Gandhis, for the Gandhis anymore. It has survived so far. But if the Congress has to thrive as well, it must become a Congress of the people.'"
366,366,"b'""The Left parties in Bengal got zero seats in 2019, 2021, and now in 2024. What is there to read in their mouthpiece anymore?"" Biswas told ThePrint. ""I had thought the CPI (M) would get at least 3 seats this time from Bengal. And our Srijan (Bhattacharyya) would definitely be among the winners. Even Rahul Gandhi could revive the fortunes of the Congress, but our good girls and boys like Srijan, Dipsita (Dhar) and Sayan (Banerjee) could not bring the CPI(M) back.""\n\nSrijan Bhattacharyya, 31, state secretary of the Students\' Federation of India and the CPI(M) candidate for the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency, understands the disillusionment of supporters like Biswas. With his smart one-liners and positive campaign messaging focusing on ""people\'s issues"", Bhattacharya became the crush of many young voters from Jadavpur University, and large crowds thronged to his rallies in the largely middle-class constituency. But on 4 June, results day, he finished third with 258,712 votes, trailing behind Trinamool Congress\' Saayoni Ghosh with 717,899 votes, and BJP\'s Anirban Ganguly with 459,698 votes.\n\n""There was huge support for some of us from the CPI(M) on social media and on the streets. But it was a bubble,"" Bhattacharyya told ThePrint over the phone. ""We need to go beyond our echo chambers now. The big crowd we saw at our Brigade Parade rally on 7 January did not translate into seats.""\n\nAlso Read: It\'s time for BJP\'s \'ghar wapsi\' into RSS fold now -- 2024 LS election results are a signal\n\nThe 7 January rally at the historic Brigade Parade Ground was a symbolic passing-of-the-baton-to the next-generation by the CPI(M), a party often criticised in West Bengal for failing to come out of the hangover of the Jyoti Basu-Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee-Anil Biswas-Biman Bose era. While Basu and Bhattacharjee ran Left Front governments for a combined 34 years in the state, Bose succeeded Biswas as the state secretary in charge of party affairs.\n\nAt the much-vaunted rally, another veteran leader and the current state secretary Md. Salim signalled a generational shift in the party.\n\n""We are sowing the seeds to help them grow into plants... we will play the role of gardeners, provide fertilisers and irrigate the field well to help them grow,"" he said to the cheering crowd.\n\nEveryone took note of the crop of fresh faces at the rally. As journalist Swati Das pointed out, the CPI(M) had replaced its ""weather-beaten and battle-scarred veterans"" with young leaders who had made their name in student politics. This, she observed, seemed to be an attempt to shed the ""historical baggage"" of its ""disastrous last few years in government, when the party alienated its own support base"".\n\nSpeaking at Brigade Ground, Srijan Bhattacharyya famously flipped Shah Rukh Khan\'s dialogue from the 2023 hit Jawan.\n\n""Baap ko haat lagane se pehle bete se baat karna parega (Talk to the son before laying a hand on the father),"" he said.\n\nIt was not just that one smart line. It was the issues of roti, kapda and makaan that Bhattacharya and the other fresh faces in the poll fray emphasised during the campaign that gave many Left supporters hope that the CPI(M) wouldn\'t come a cropper this time around.\n\nTrue to their promises made at Brigade ground, the CPI(M) showcased a burst of young energy. Apart from Srijan Bhattacharya, there were Dipsita Dhar, 30, from Sreerampur constituency; Sayan Banerjee, 30, from Tamluk; Debraj Barman, 36, from Jalpaiguri; Nirab Khan, 43, from Bardhaman Purba; Saira Shah Halim, 46, from Kolkata Dakshin; Nilanjan Dasgupta, 50, from Bankura, and others.\n\nIn their internal analysis post-defeat, the CPI(M) concluded that the ""communal binary"" of the TMC and the BJP had divided the state sharply along religious lines, benefiting both while keeping the CPM (M) and other Left parties out of the game.\n\nKolkata Dakshin candidate Saira Shah Halim squarely blamed this ""binary"" for her loss.\n\n""I had managed to break this binary during the 2022 Ballygunge Assembly polls and increase the Left\'s vote share from 5 to 30 percent. This time I failed because the TMC and some local Muslim leaders branded me as a lesser Muslim,"" Halim told ThePrint\n\nAn example of this, according to Halim, was that just before the first polling date on 19 April, the influential Urdu daily Akhbar-e-Mashriq ran a story claiming she spoke the language of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The paper referred to an old interview in which Halim had opposed loudspeakers in both mandirs and masjids.\n\n""They made it look like I was speaking out against the Azaan. I was misquoted and wasn\'t prepared for such communalism in Ballygunge (an assembly segment under Kolkata Dakshin), which is a mostly upper-middle-class area bang in the middle of the city,"" she said.\n\nThe niece of actor Naseeruddin Shah and daughter of a retired army officer, Halim had banked on ""progressive politics"" in her campaign, focusing on roti, kapda, and makaan, and also targeting the TMC for various scams, such as the teacher recruitment case that sent former state education minister Partha Chatterjee and others to jail.\n\n""My opponents ran a sexist and communal campaign with Bengali rights outfit Bangla Pokkho that tacitly supports the TMC,"" Halim alleged. ""They branded me an outsider, a \'gutka-chewing Bihari\'. I am not even from Bihar. My family comes from Uttar Pradesh, but I have spent more than 22 years in Kolkata. I am as Kolkatan as they come.""\n\nBhattacharyya also said that Bengal largely votes along religious lines now -- something that was ""unthinkable"" even 10 years ago.\n\n""West Bengal was a communally sensitive state after Partition and Bangladesh\'s Liberation War. One of the Left Front government\'s biggest achievements in the 34 years it ruled the state was to keep communalism aside,"" he said.\n\nBhattacharya blamed TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for making every Bengali voter acutely aware of their religious and caste identity.\n\n""It is not just Hindu-Muslim. Even among Hindus, this entire controversy around Matuas came up during her reign. She has succeeded in creating binaries, which in turn create vote banks based on identity,"" he said. ""Because of her, the BJP-RSS has made deep inroads in the state. We have to create an alternative political narrative.""\n\nFor some Left-leaning voters, Bengal\'s Communist parties have erred in targeting Mamata Banerjee instead of focusing on the BJP as their main ideological opponent.\n\nFor Sayandeb Chowdhury, who votes in Kolkata and teaches at the School of Interwoven Arts and Sciences at Krea University in Andhra Pradesh, this is major misstep. While he calls himself a Left Liberal, Chowdhury is quick to distance himself from the Bengal Communists for their ""many historic blunders"" since losing power in the state to Mamata Banerjee in 2011.\n\n""Historically, the Left has risen against fascist forces across the world. In West Bengal, the Left devoted all their energy in attacking Banerjee, most whose social schemes align with the Left,"" he said. ""As a result, the BJP got the space to grow in West Bengal. And Mamata, on her part, fashioned herself as the only force that can stop the BJP in Bengal. The Left is left with no political space today.""\n\nChowdhury also disputes the notion that Bengal is entirely split along communal lines. He acknowledges some BJP-RSS penetration, but insists many voters primarily support Mamata ""as she promises to keep the BJP away"".\n\nAllying with the wrong partner was another of the Left\'s ""blunders"", according to Aroon Shah, vice-president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the BJP\'s youth wing. He pointed to the 2016 assembly polls when the Left and Congress formed an alliance.\n\nThis alliance, Shah claimed, benefited Congress while Left voters gravitated toward either the TMC or BJP.\n\n""It was a Himalayan blunder on their part and the Left today is a vote cutter that ends up helping the TMC. They are a neither-here-nor-there party that does not even condemn TMC\'s post-poll violence after winning elections,"" he said.\n\nAlso Read: Bengal is ready for BJP\'s Bhadralok Hindutva. Bhadralok Marxism is on its way out\n\nBad political decisions are not the only reason for the downfall of the Left, according to some long-term supporters.

""What they need to do instead is walk the length and breadth of Bengal and remind people who they are, what they stand for.""\n\nChowdhury suggests the Left could take a cue from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra. This march across the nation reportedly helped Congress improve its tally of seats from 52 in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to 99 in 2024.\n\n""Gandhi managed to consolidate the political space from the Centre to the Left by walking the talk, connecting with people, using phrases like \'mohabbat ki dukaan\' in a highly communal political atmosphere,"" Chowdhury said. ""The Left in Bengal should have a political language, forge new alliances with socially marginalised groups like Ambedkarites, and walk the talk by being visible to voters like Rahul Gandhi during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.""\n\nIt is not as if the Left did not walk. The 7 January Brigade Parade rally was the culmination of a 2,200-km walk by party cadres and supporters across Bengal as part of the youth wing\'s Insaaf Yatra, which demanded jobs and education and protested against BJP\'s communalism and TMC\'s corruption. However, it didn\'t get them seats in 2024.\n\nFor Srijan Bhattacharya, it\'s a matter of increasing the step count through more such walks to get their message across the state.'"

I am a regular worker of the BJP, and I will fulfill any responsibility given to me by the party.

It went to Jannayak Janta Party\'s (JJP) Jogi Ram Sihag in the 2019 assembly polls. However, Sihag had a falling out with JJP leader Dushyant Chautala after the latter\'s exit from the Haryana government, and he lent his support to the BJP\'s Hisar candidate in the 2024 Parliamentary elections. In these elections, the Congress candidate Jai Parkash got the lead over his BJP rival Ranjit Singh in six out of nine assembly segments of Hisar. However, Singh polled 11,657 votes more than Parkash, which will make Sihag\'s claim to a BJP ticket stronger.\n\nAlso read: With assembly elections approaching, a dozen dynasts pad up to enter poll fray in Haryana\n\nSaweety Boora was born on 10 January, 1993, in a family of farmers in Hisar.

However, in 2009, at the behest of her father Mahender Singh Boora, Saweety left Kabaddi and took up boxing.

371,371,"b""The answers to all three came by the afternoon of counting day, 4 June. Not only must the BJP take the Congress and Rahul seriously, his party also sees a realistic route to power in 2029. At the very least, it has sprung back to life and is back in the fight. You will see it through the monsoon session beginning next Monday.\n\nThis session will have the added tadka (seasoning) of the Union Budget as well. The difference a rejuvenated Congress makes will also be evident from how the rest of the Opposition conducts itself. Read the op-ed that Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien wrote in The Indian Express this Friday.\n\nHe opens his argument by asking who benefits more from parliamentary adjournments now. The obvious implication is that it's the treasury benches.\n\nWhen the Opposition was in a hopeless minority, outshouted, outnumbered and further squashed by the chair, adjournments and walkouts were desperate escape measures. Now, they'd rather be on the wrestling mat -- or in the akhara if that sounds more apt -- and wrestle.\n\nO'Brien's party, the TMC, has done brilliantly by itself in West Bengal. Would they, however, be so upbeat if the Congress had not come back to life this time? No opposition alliance can be credible without a strong core. That's the expectation on which the Congress had been failing so far. Now, this has changed.\n\nEven as I write this column late Friday afternoon as usual, I see on my television screen J.P. Nadda, still the BJP president in his super-extended term, speaking in Odisha and focusing mostly on the Congress and the Gandhi family, especially the siblings.\n\nHe calls them the educated illiterate ('padhe likhe anpadh'). This, in a state where the Congress doesn't count for one bit. At least not yet. This leaves no doubt about the answers to the first two of the three questions we posited from Rahul's point of view. For the BJP, the Congress and the Gandhi trio matter.\n\nAlso Read: Modi's new universe: the normal irritants of democracy & awkward chai with Rahul Gandhi\n\nThe answer to the third question will need to come from Rahul himself. Since he was first elected an MP in 2004, he has built a political image he'll need to get rid of. This is the image of shoot-and-scoot politics.\n\nDon't blame social media or the BJP/RSS's formidable whisper machine for it. Two decades in public life is long enough for reputations to be built, for better or worse. Until the 2024 elections, his reputation was one of uncertain commitment. If he moves on from it now after this summer's success, he'll change not just that image, but also answer that most important question: Does the Congress have a chance to win back power?\n\nSo far, he had had two-and-a-half major successes. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, he electrified his party by winning 21 seats in Uttar Pradesh. Almost all these candidates were his choices, several from the Youth Congress, which he then helmed.\n\nThe second was the 2018 winter victories in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The half was the Gujarat assembly election of 2017 when he ran the BJP close. It was an astute campaign, built on a coalition of rebellious young caste leaders. It gave the BJP a scare.\n\nModi had to carry out a humongous rearguard campaign to salvage the state for his party. How close this election had been, and how sweet his victory, showed in his speech to his party after the results. Cameras caught tears in his eyes, not something you see often, and we took note of it in a National Interest column on 30 December, 2017.\n\nThe important thing is that after each one of these, Rahul didn't stay back to build on what had been achieved. The post-2009 period saw his somewhat curious evolution into a dissident within his party, culminating in that infamous public rejection of his own government's ordinance on convicted politicians, something he has regretted multiple times in interviews subsequently.\n\nAfter the state victories in December 2018, no attention was paid to building a coalition or rejuvenating his party. He seemed distracted and disconnected. As he did after Gujarat, 2017. Each of these moments could have been a turning point for his politics.\n\nThat's why even his revival in this general election has drawn scepticism from his supporters. Their scepticism is his rivals' hope. That one job done, even if successfully, he will lose interest again. Shoot and scoot.\n\nThat he hasn't done so yet, and has continued to be active on the political street, in public debate and on social media, signals an important change. It will give his party hope. Maybe the achievement of reducing Modi well below the majority mark will now motivate him to stay committed.\n\nOr maybe a decade of Modi, setbacks, humiliation, insults and ridicule, as well as the targeting of the party and its key people by the 'agencies', have collectively brought in a new resolve. If he does stay on and focused, the third question is answered. The Congress can realistically hope for a return to power.\n\nAlso Read: Muslims made their vote count. This time Hindus built a coalition with them\n\nAt which point I can bring to your attention two National Interest articles on Rahul written a decade apart. The first, on 6 April, 2013 when he took over as Congress vice president and made his 'power is poison' speech in Jaipur, listed what we saw as three fallacies or errors in his politics.\n\nThe first two pertained to his flawed understanding of Indian inequality, and then aspiration. The third was simply about his belief that power is poison. We had then written that he had better reflect on it. That in a democracy, power is no poison. It is a wonderful gift, an honour, and a cherished privilege the voters give you. Good leaders embrace it with joy, gratitude and humility. That power is poison, we had written, is a feudal proposition, not a democratic one.\n\nThe next article, on 24 December, 2022, came in the midst of his Bharat Jodo Yatra and raised some of the same questions. We noted then that he seemed to be enjoying the attention, the crowds and the argumentation more than before. He was building a campaign on ideological terms -- Bharat Jodo versus Bharat Todo, love versus hate, secular versus communal, Gandhi versus Savarkar -- and seemed to be enjoying it.\n\nWhile noting this, we had raised two more questions. One, what does the Congress want? The answer was easy: power. The next was trickier: what does Rahul want? Does he also want what his party does? In which case, has he changed his mind on power being poison? Has a decade in wilderness and ridicule persuaded him to see the virtue in power? Only if the answer is yes can the Congress party ever hope to return to power."""
372,372,"b'India\'s Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha made a blunder diverting attention from youth\n\nUntil Rahul Gandhi made his debut speech in Parliament as Leader of the Opposition, the big national issue in India was the bungling of the medical school entrance exams. Youth across India were aghast at the allegations of question papers being sold in advance, irregularities in awarding marks, and cheating at exam centres.\n\nThe National Eligibility cum Entrance Test or NEET was the big issue the opposition was expected to corner the government with, right at the beginning of PM Modi\'s third term.\n\nRahul Gandhi spent the first 30 minutes of his 90-minute long speech talking about religion, making remarks that left enough room for the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party to creatively misinterpret and target Rahul Gandhi as anti-Hindu. We can now keep debating what Rahul Gandhi said and did not say, in the process taking attention away from NEET.\n\nYes, Rahul Gandhi did talk about NEET -- at the fag end of his speech. Usually people begin with their strongest point, leaving out their weak points. Religion is a weak point as far as the Congress party is concerned. The BJP has owned Hindu nationalism. Why would Rahul Gandhi want to play on the BJP\'s pitch when he was gifted with a great pitch to play on, the NEET issue?\n\nGood Hindu, Bad Hindu\n\nIt is therefore strange to see liberal commentators go into a paroxysm of joy over Rahul Gandhi\'s NEET self-goal. Rahul Gandhi is reclaiming Hinduism from the BJP, they say. They point out how Rahul Gandhi emphatically made the point that PM Modi, his party the BJP, and parent organisation RSS do not represent all Hindus.\n\nBut even if Rahul Gandhi were to win this argument, would it help him win votes?\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\nThe 2024 Lok Sabha election results have shown the limits of the use of religion in politics. The BJP was banking on a Hindutva wave after the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Fluorescent saffron flags were put up in every nook and corner of the country for months. The BJP\'s vote share and seats actually declined. The greatest shock was in Uttar Pradesh, where Hindutva has historically worked the most.\n\nThe BJP lost even the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat which contains Ayodhya and Ram Mandir. Rahul Gandhi has been trying to take credit for the victory of alliance partner Samajwadi Party in Faizabad. A look at how the SP defeated the BJP in Faizabad will tell you why Rahul Gandhi\'s obsessive focus on religious pop philosophy is knocking on the wrong door.\n\nMandal is back\n\nFaizabad is a ""general"" seat with a large population of Pasis, a Dalit community. The SP cleverly gave the ticket to a Pasi Dalit candidate, something parties rarely do on general seats. The campaign of candidate Awadesh Prasad focused on economic disenchantment and caste issues.\n\nIn his campaign, the BJP candidate, Lallu Singh, said the BJP needed to win over 400 seats to be able to change the Constitution. This gave credence to the fears among the Dalit community that the Constitution could be amended to snatch away their affirmative action. On the other hand was a Dalit candidate whose slogan was telling: ""Na Mathura, na Kashi, Abki baar Awadesh Pasi."" (Neither Mathura nor Kashi, this time Awadesh Pasi). It is difficult to translate how powerful this slogan is in shifting the political agenda from religion to caste.\n\nWe have seen this since the late 1980s if not earlier. Religion and caste are the two main competing narratives of Indian politics. Whether it was after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 or in Faizabad Lok Sabha seat in 2024, the BJP\'s setbacks have often come due to caste.\n\nIt is therefore a self-goal for Rahul Gandhi to position himself as someone inspired by religion than caste justice. It would have been much more fruitful if he had focused on the demand for a caste census rather than going into details of Hindu mythology.\n\nRead more by Shivam Vij Can Rahul Gandhi bridge the gap from ideology to leadership? Why the BJP campaign that started with a bang ended in a whimper How Akhilesh Yadav helped turn the page in Uttar Pradesh politics Child is the father of man\n\nAcross the world, the most powerful agents of change are youth. Whether it is revolutions overthrowing dictators or tectonic electoral shifts in democracies, youth are at the forefront of change.\n\nWhether it was the Modi wave of 2014 or the Ram Janambhoomi movement of the early \'90s or the Lokpal movement of 2011 -- you\'ll always find youth at the forefront of driving change.\n\nIt is thus surprising how little the opposition has been tapping youth energy for change. Survey after survey shows PM Modi\'s popularity with youth today is not what it used to be in 2013-14. Unemployment is a huge part of that simmering discontent. Since at least 2016, every political survey has shown unemployment to be the biggest issue for voters, ahead of even inflation.\n\nRahul Gandhi has done big campaigns on corruption (Rafale) and secularism (Bharat Jodo Yatra). He speaks against hate and crony capitalism often. The opposition made a big impact in Parliament over violence in Manipur.\n\nYet the biggest, most powerful national issue -- unemployment -- always becomes part of a bullet check-list rather than the main campaign. Rahul Gandhi in his speech did speak of unemployment as he did of NEET. He managed to make some impact on the Agniveer issue, the reduction of employment in the armed forces to a four year contract.\n\nBut the obsession over wanting to sound profound with religious pop philosophy took away from what should have been a singular theme -- youth. If and when big political change happens in India, it will have youth at its forefront.\n\nShivam Vij\n\n@DilliDurAst\n\nShivam Vij is a journalist and political commentator based in New Delhi.

373,373,"b'Congress managed to prevent Lok Sabha elections from becoming another Modi-vs-Rahul clash\n\nIndia\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a surprisingly large number of interviews during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did not give a single interview during the whole campaign -- not one, not even to a friendly YouTube channel.\n\nThis is part of the reason why the 2024 elections could not become the usual Modi-versus-Rahul dichotomy.\n\nRahul Gandhi\'s gaffes -- real, fake, or edited videos -- didn\'t dominate the election conversation on social media like they used to.\n\nHis election rally speeches didn\'t get good play on social or mainstream media, and the second edition of the Bharat Jodo Yatra (Unite India march), in the weeks before the election, didn\'t make much impact. By having a non-Gandhi as party president and holding no post himself, he effaced himself from the main stage to some extent.\n\nAll of this ensured the election wasn\'t seen as Modi versus Rahul. It was often Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vs. INDIA combine.\n\nThe BJP seemed to understand the problem but couldn\'t do much about it. The prime minister\'s comments on Rahul Gandhi -- even making a rare exception of mentioning him by name and tweeting a contrast video of Rahul and himself -- didn\'t elicit the response they used to.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel Displacement activity\n\nRahul Gandhi has successfully managed to shed the image of a clueless young man, regardless of how fair or unfair that tag was. That the BJP\'s barbs against him are no longer working is the ultimate proof that Rahul Gandhi has finally evolved.\n\nHe has done so by displacing the label with the radical left image. After the 2019 debacle, Rahul Gandhi found refuge in ideology.\n\nWhen his party seemed to dither in taking a strong stand for secularism, he was willing to go the extra mile for it. He championed the caste census, an issue his party used to be evasive about.\n\nThe Bharat Jodo Yatra also neutralised the criticism that he was a reluctant part-time politician. Yet it wasn\'t enough to transform him into someone people desired as a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nA Lokniti-CSDS survey has claimed that people in Uttar Pradesh preferred him to Modi as prime minister. With due respect, this is bunkum.\n\nIf Rahul Gandhi was ahead of Modi in PM choice ratings in the most important Hindi heartland state, the Congress would have been in power already.\n\nGetting there\n\nThe question is, can Rahul Gandhi get there? There was a time when it seemed impossible he would ever shed the old tag. Today he has, with some help from the BJP\'s own anti-incumbency. If he has managed this, how does he get to the next level?\n\nFive years ago, when voters were asked why they were voting for BJP despite unemployment, the answer would be, \'Can Rahul Gandhi create jobs?\'\n\nToday unemployed youth are not defending the BJP and were seen voting against it in many places, especially in UP. They don\'t mention Rahul Gandhi anymore, which means they do not speak positively or negatively about him.\n\nRead more by Shivam Vij Why the BJP campaign that started with a bang ended in a whimper Indian elections: What has changed in Uttar Pradesh politics, and what has not How Akhilesh Yadav helped turn the page in Uttar Pradesh politics The leader has to be ready\n\nWhen asked about Rahul Gandhi, a common refrain from voters today is that they don\'t know much about him. That\'s an odd thing to say -- what they mean is that they haven\'t seen him govern.\n\nThis points to Rahul Gandhi\'s blunder of not accepting any ministerial post in 2004-2014 when his party was leading the UPA coalition.\n\nHe was president of the Congress party for less than two years. How do voters know he has the ability to perform a task as difficult as running a country of 1.4 billion people? That\'s a big ask.\n\nIndians have always trusted leaders who have shown a past track record of governance or being engaged with affairs of the state. Narendra Modi\'s big pitch in 2014 was that he had demonstrated his abilities in Gujarat (""Gujarat model"") to be given a chance nationally.\n\nJust as Modi shifted his image from radical right to a mainstream governance image as Gujarat chief minister, Rahul Gandhi would now benefit from shifting his image from radical left to mainstream governance.\n\nThe best way to do so would be to accept the post of Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and speak as a serious speaker on matters of governance, policy, and public welfare.\n\n2024 has shown the possibilities that open up in Indian politics in unexpected ways.

374,374,"b""As India navigates its political and social challenges, a proactive opposition is crucial\n\nThe appointment of Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Indian Parliament last week marks a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape. This development not only signals a significant resurgence for the Congress party, which almost doubled its parliamentary seats in the latest elections, but also carries profound implications for India's democratic health, secular ideals, and pursuit of social justice.\n\nDespite analysts' expectations, the grand old party saw its best results since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, increasing its seats from 52 to 99. This election result denied Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) an outright majority, forcing it to rely on coalition allies.\n\nIn this context, Rahul Gandhi's appointment as Leader of the Opposition is a strong assertion of India's democratic resilience. The role of the opposition is critical in a parliamentary democracy as it ensures checks and balances on the ruling government.\n\nFor the past decade, this crucial position was left unoccupied due to the Congress party's poor electoral performance. Now, with Gandhi at the helm, there is a renewed opportunity to hold the Modi-led NDA government accountable both inside and outside the Parliament, fostering a more transparent and responsive governance structure.\n\nRead more by Prof Ashok Swain Rise of strong opposition a pivotal moment for India's democracy Conflicts and climate change aggravate world's hunger crisis G7 leaders confront global challenges together Vital for a democratic process\n\nA robust opposition is essential for any democracy. It scrutinises government actions, offers alternative policies, and represents the diverse views of the electorate.\n\nGandhi's leadership in this role will provide a necessary counterbalance to the Modi's administration, ensuring that the ruling party does not alter India's secular constitution without challenge or oversight. His presence will reinvigorate parliamentary debates and discussions, which are vital for a healthy democratic process.\n\nGandhi has consistently advocated for an inclusive India where all religious communities coexist harmoniously. His leadership offers a platform to reinforce secular values, ensuring that legislation and government actions do not favour one religious group over others. This commitment to secularism is crucial for maintaining social harmony and protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of their faith.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Gandhi's political philosophy is social justice. He has been a vocal advocate for the rights of marginalised communities, including Dalits, Adivasis, and women. His approach to politics is deeply rooted in the principles of equality and justice, aiming to bridge the socioeconomic divide that persists in Indian society.\n\nAs LoP, Gandhi will have the influence to push for policies that address these inequalities. His role in key parliamentary committees will enable him to advocate for legislation that promotes social welfare, education, and health care, aiming to uplift those who have been historically disadvantaged. This focus on social justice is essential for creating a more equitable society where every individual has the opportunity to thrive.\n\nUnity is critical\n\nThe Congress party, under Gandhi's leadership, has managed to rally significant support from other opposition parties. Key allies like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) from West Bengal in the east, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Samajwadi Party (SP) from the Hindi heartland of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and the Maharashtra opposition alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have expressed their support for Gandhi's appointment. This unity is critical for presenting a cohesive and strong opposition front against the BJP.\n\nEach of these parties brings its regional strengths and voter base, creating a diverse and inclusive opposition alliance. This coalition is not just a political strategy but a reflection of India's pluralistic society. By working together, these parties can more effectively challenge the ruling government's policies and advocate for a more inclusive and progressive agenda.\n\nThere is no doubt that this role will be a significant test for Gandhi's leadership. He may consider appointing a shadow cabinet, similar to those in the UK and Australia. Appointing a shadow cabinet can strengthen the opposition's ability to coordinate scrutiny of the government, develop and communicate alternative policies, enhance public credibility, and prepare for future governance.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel An equitable future for all\n\nGandhi's previous initiatives, such as the Bharat Jodo Yatra, showcased his ability to connect with people at the grass roots level and address their concerns. His emphasis on democratic values, transparency, and accountability aligns with the aspirations of many Indians who seek a government that is more responsive and less authoritarian.\n\nThis leadership role provides him with a platform to demonstrate his capabilities and potentially strengthen his position to become the country's future prime minister.\n\nRahul Gandhi's appointment as the Leader of the Opposition is a momentous development for India's democracy. It reinforces the importance of a strong and effective opposition, champions the country's secular ethos, and promotes social justice. Gandhi's leadership in this role has the potential to transform the political landscape, offering a robust challenge to the ruling BJP and advocating for policies that benefit all sections of society.\n\nAs India navigates its complex political, social, and economic challenges, the presence of a vigilant and proactive opposition led by Rahul Gandhi is crucial. It ensures that democracy not only survives but also thrives, secularism is upheld, and social justice is pursued, creating a more inclusive and equitable future for all Indians.\n\nAshok Swain\n\n@ProfAshokSwain\n\nAshok Swain is a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University, Sweden"""
375,375,"b'Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is expected to appear in an MP-MLA court in Uttar Pradesh\'s Sultanpur. On June 26, the court directed Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on July 2 in a defamation case filed against him for alleged objectionable remarks about Union Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\nThe defamation case against Rahul Gandhi was filed in 2018 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijay Mishra over the Congress leader\'s alleged objectionable remarks about Amit Shah. Earlier this year, Gandhi interrupted his ""Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra"" in Amethi to attend a court session on February 20, where he was subsequently granted bail.\n\nDefamation suits galore\n\nRahul Gandhi has faced multiple defamation cases across India. These cases have largely been filed by the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) members, stemming from various statements he has made against political figures and organisations. Broadly his cases are for making alleged defamatory allegations against the BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah, or the RSS.\n\nRemarks against VD Savarkar\n\nThere are two such cases -- in Pune and Thane each. In April 2023, Satyaki Savarkar, the grandnephew of VD Savarkar, filed a defamation complaint against Rahul Gandhi. Satyaki accused Rahul of making false and malicious statements about Savarkar during a trip to the UK in March 2023. Rahul allegedly claimed that Savarkar wrote about beating up a Muslim man with his friends, which Satyaki contested as untrue.\n\nThe Thane case stems from a complaint lodged by Vandana Dongre, a Shiv Sena functionary, in November 2022 against Rahul for his remarks suggesting that Savarkar had written mercy petitions to the British out of fear, thus betraying Indian freedom fighters.\n\nRemarks against the Modi surname\n\nAt least three cases -- in Surat, Ranchi and Patna -- are underway over his comments on Modi surname during an election rally in 2019.\n\nRahul Gandhi made the comment at a rally in Karnataka in 2019, alleging that all thieves share the Modi surname. The comment led to a defamation case filed by BJP MLA Purnesh Modi. He was found guilty in the case in a lower court. The Gujarat High Court declined to stay Rahul\'s conviction but the Supreme Court last year suspended the execution of the sentence.\n\nFollowing the same 2019 comment, Pradip Modi, an advocate, filed a suit in Ranchi. Rahul\'s appearance has been exempted by the Jharkhand High Court pending further hearings.\n\nSushil Modi, the senior BJP leader who passed away in May this year, filed a defamation suit in April 2019 in Patna over the same Modi surname remark.\n\nRemarks against Amit Shah\n\nAt least two cases were filed in Ahmedabad against Rahul Gandhi for defaming Shah. In May 2019, BJP member Krishnavadan Brahmbhatt filed a complaint against Rahul for calling Amit Shah a ""murder accused"" at a rally.\n\nA second case in Ahmedabad involved accusations of money laundering linked to Shah during the 2016 demonetisation, filed by the Ahmedabad District Co-Operative Bank and its chairperson Ajay Patel.\n\nRemarks against RSS\n\nMultiple cases were filed against Rahul Gandhi over his controversial comments about the RSS. These cases are in Haridwar in Uttarakhand, Bhiwandi in Rajasthan, Mumbai and Guwahati.\n\nFollowing Rahul\'s Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2023, where he described the RSS as the ""21st century Kauravas,"" Kamal Bhadoria, an RSS volunteer, filed a defamation complaint in Haridwar.\n\nIn 2014, RSS worker Rajesh Kunte filed a complaint over Rahul\'s statement linking the RSS to Mahatma Gandhi\'s assassination. This case is ongoing, with evidence currently being recorded.\n\nIn Mumbai, RSS worker Dhrutiman Joshi filed a case in 2018 against Rahul and CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury for allegedly linking the RSS to journalist Gauri Lankesh\'s murder. Another case was filed in Mumbai by BJP leader Mahesh Shrishrimal in 2018 over Rahul\'s comments on the Rafale deal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn 2016, RSS worker Anjan Kumar Bora filed a suit against Rahul for claiming that RSS workers prevented him from entering a monastery in Barpeta, Assam.'"
376,376,"b""After the inauguration of Narendra Modi's third term as India's premier, the key question doing the rounds is whether his reduced parliamentary strength will author a noticeable change in the style and substance of his governance.\n\nIn both 2014 and 2019, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) returned with a clear majority and faced a divided and battered opposition, so weak that for 10 years, it couldn't elect an opposition leader, as no party met the mandatory criterion of having at least 10 per cent of the seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha.\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which the BJP is the leading constituent, won 336 seats in 2014 and 351 in 2019, giving it a comfortable majority (close to the two-thirds majority of 362) in the Lok Sabha. As a result, the ruling coalition was able to push the desired legislation, both ordinary and constitutional, through parliament without much ado.\n\nBut now the scenario has changed. Having won only 240 seats in 2024, the BJP falls well short of a simple majority of 272. This means that for the first time, Prime Minister Modi is presiding over a minority government and is compelled to form a coalition with other NDA parties. The total parliamentary strength of the NDA is 293, well past the 272 mark, but well short of having a two-thirds majority.\n\nNot only this, but for the first time in 10 years, the opposition has a leader in Rahul Gandhi, Modi's rival-in-chief.\n\nThe NDA isn't an electoral alliance in the strict sense of the word, as the constituent parties did not go to the polls under a common symbol. Nor is its opponent, the Indian National Development Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). This means that in both cases, the constituents are free to chart their way.\n\nThis augurs both well and badly for the BJP. It can entice some opposition MPs to bolster its strength; it may also lose support from some NDA members, which may bring the government down.\n\nIndia, including the BJP, does not have a good experience with minority governments. In 1996, BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee resigned within two weeks of being sworn in as premier, as he was not able to secure the mandatory vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha. In the 1989 elections, the ruling Congress emerged as the single largest party but fell well short of a majority, as the BJP has done in 2024. But Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi preferred to quit instead of trying to form a minority government. No doubt, Modi and Gandhi are as similar as chalk and cheese.\n\nEvidently, Modi is in a much better position than Vajpayee was in 1996, and there is no way he will not be able to secure a vote of confidence. His NDA partners will continue to support him as long as they are kept happy. Modi has already given five cabinet slots to them. Nor will the opposition be keen to de-seat him.\n\nGiven INDIA's large and varied composition, its government, granted that it can get the numbers, will be susceptible to falling apart at the drop of a hat. Modi also holds the trump card that every prime minister holds in parliamentary democracy: if pushed to the wall, he can have the house dissolved at will and seek a fresh mandate.\n\nThe question thus is not whether Modi will survive but whether he can govern the way he is used to governing - with abandon. Another question is whether he will continue with his divisive policies, which have drawn clear-cut cleavages between the ultra-rich and those at the middle and bottom of the economic heap and between the majority and minority communities.\n\nPolitics is a mind game. When one is in a commanding position, everyone, including oneself, one's allies and rivals and other stakeholders, such as the courts and the media, is aware of this. The sense of untrammelled power often brings with it veritable arrogance and disdain for others.\n\nAs a rule, courts hesitate to shoot down a law piloted by - and even otherwise be on the wrong side of - a government commanding an absolute majority. This is perhaps the reason why the Supreme Court of India upheld the change in the status of Jammu and Kashmir, India's sole Muslim-majority state, introduced by the Modi government in August 2019.\n\nMany independent observers believe that the court did not address the systemic issues raised by the petitioners. The apex court's November 2019 decision in the Babri Masjid-Ram Mandir case is also a case in point. It is the other way around when one slips on the power curve.\n\nModi, like Imran Khan and Donald Trump, is a cult figure. Such leaders owe their popularity in large measures to their blustering style, uncompromising attitude, and larger-than-life image. Should they offer an olive branch to the other side, or even behave in a mellow manner, their followers will interpret it as a sign of weakness.\n\nAt the same time, Modi has risen in the ranks by dint of hard work and shrewdness. Such people are pragmatists and can blow hot or cold according to the circumstances. This will likely place Modi in a dilemma, as his cult leader status and pragmatism will pull him in opposite directions.\n\nBy way of resolving the dilemma, he may appear tough and uncompromising on camera, while being willing to give in off-camera when necessary. In Modi's new cabinet, the core cabinet members have retained their positions. So has the powerful Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. This sends out the message that despite losing the majority, Modi remains fully in control as ever.\n\nOver the years, the BJP has rewarded mega industrialists, who have duly reciprocated by contributing generously to the party. The BJP's growth model, which ironically it inherited from the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government (2004-14), has made India one of the fastest-growing economies, which also has one of the highest levels of inequality, in the world.\n\nNot only that, Big Business bankrolls the corporate media, which sings Modi's praises day in, and day out. It was the corporate media, whose exit polls had given the BJP an absolute majority in the recent elections, which turned out to be a hoax. Should Modi go for a more egalitarian growth model, it will not only alienate his supporters from the corporate world and the media that they control, it may also slow down the economy for at least a few years.\n\nNeither of the likely outcomes will be acceptable to Modi. Hence, he is likely to persist with his trickle-down growth model mixed with some cosmetic measures, such as subsidizing low-income households.\n\nDivisive politics is a kiss of death for a diverse polity. But for the BJP, religious plurality has historically been a source of weakness in Hindu-majority India, making it susceptible to foreign domination at the hands of first Muslims and then Europeans. The only way to rejuvenate India then is to put in place a monolithic society with total Hindu dominance.\n\nIt is this narrative that enabled the BJP to expand, capture the states and finally take New Delhi by storm. Should it depart from this narrative, it may find the ground on which its edifice rests slip. Such seismic change will hardly be viable for any populist political party.\n\nWhile Modi will govern the way he and his party deem fit, the role of a rejuvenated opposition, with the Congress at its head, will also be important. Since his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra,' (Unite India March), Rahul Gandhi has earned nationwide respect, not as a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty but in his own right. If he can keep the opposition united and make it speak with one voice, an effective bulwark can be put in place against the BJP's majoritarianism.\n\nThe writer is an Islamabad-based columnist.

Born in 1980, he graduated in Computer Science Engineering from Noor College of Engineering, JNTU in 2002. Following a successful decade-long career as an entrepreneur, Anirudh transitioned into social work, leveraging his family's political background to build a support base in rural areas.\n\nAnirudh's political journey began over a decade ago during the early days of Telangana's formation. He strategically built his support base by addressing local issues and fostering connections through social work. Establishing the 'Anirudh Yuva Sena', he engaged with village youths to understand and resolve community problems. In 2014, he addressed water shortages by digging borewells in several villages and providing financial assistance to families for funeral expenses. Anirudh also improved school facilities by providing essentials such as blackboards, books, and constructed toilets.\n\nDespite his efforts, Anirudh faced setbacks in his political career, including unsuccessful attempts to secure an MLA ticket from the YSR Congress and Congress parties in 2019. However, he continued his activism, raising issues like illegal land grabbing, sand mining, and real estate ventures by BRS leaders. His persistent opposition to the BRS government earned him a reputation as a formidable political figure.\n\nInspired by Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, Anirudh undertook a 100-day 'Jadcherla Hat Jodo Yatra,' visiting every village in the constituency and connecting with residents. His dedication to addressing local issues and building rapport with the electorate contributed to his election victory in December 2023.\n\nPost-victory, Anirudh is committed to the comprehensive development of Jadcherla. The MLA has decided to design an action plan for the holistic development of the constituency in all aspects in the next five years. He plans to build a ring road connecting National Highways 44 and 167, promote industrial growth by attracting food processing and software industries, and create employment opportunities for the youth. Additionally, he aims to enhance infrastructure, including roads, drains, and educational facilities in both rural and urban areas. His initiatives include donating shoes to over 55,000 government school children and equipping schools with digital learning tools and additional classrooms.

382,382,"b""The 'Pappu' of yesteryears is transformed into a 'Lion' as the LoP\n\nIt was the Congress-Mukt Bharat, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi yearned for. However, the recent events in the Congress have dashed the hopes of many, with the party increasing its electoral tally in the just-concluded Lok Sabha polls. Rahul Gandhi's announcement of retaining the constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, while Priyanka Gandhi is contesting from Wayanad in Kerala makes it evident that they have taken up the challenge to confront the BJP. Similarly, the decision of the Gandhi scion to take up the post of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha signifies that the 'Pappu' of yesteryears is transformed into a 'Lion' and is ready to roar.\n\nThose who thought that Rahul Gandhi will take a backseat, were surprised by his bold decisions. The two yatras - Bharat Jodo Yatra and Bharat Jodo Nyaya Yatra - of Rahul, prior to the Lok Sabha elections, have transformed him to the extent that he is no longer scared of directly confronting the Prime Minister. The Congress leader has realized that Modi, after all, is not invincible and if he continues to expose the government's failures, he can defeat him in the next elections.\n\nRahul Gandhi's maiden speech as Leader of Opposition in Parliament was a reflection of his angst against the Prime Minister. He was vitriolic and became personal in his criticism, rebutted and interjected by not only Modi, but also his Cabinet Ministers. SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, on the other hand, was also critical, but suave and cryptic in his speech. No other Opposition leader, including the firebrand Mamata Banerjee, has dared to take Modi head-on, even outside Parliament.\n\nThe 18th Lok Sabha has turned into a battleground for the two Titans - Rahul versus Modi - and in the days to come, one can expect the sparring to escalate between the two parties. Gone are the days when there used to be intellectual and forceful debates on serious topics confronting the nation. Verbal accusations and counter-attacks have vitiated the atmosphere, with even the Presiding Officers of both Houses being accused of partisan politics.\n\nWhile in the 17th Lok Sabha, it became easier for the Modi government to pass controversial Bills, like Abrogation of Article 370 and Triple Talaq Bill, enjoying two-thirds majority, now it would be difficult for them to have their own say. The INDIA bloc is united and would ensure that the BJP is halted in its tracks in passing its own Hindutva Agenda. Passage of the controversial legislation like the Uniform Civil Code is unlikely to be pursued by the Modi Government. Now, it's not only the two UP ke ladke, who are sitting together in the front row to take-on Prime Minister Modi, but other stalwarts in the TMC and RJD, too, who are determined to be on the offensive.\n\nThe animosity between the Treasury Benches and the Opposition Benches is so glaring that it threatens to engulf the seriousness of the parliamentary debates. The diatribes and the punches hurled against each other robs substance from the speeches and exposes the hollowness of the speakers.\n\nOne wonders how the two leaders, Modi and Rahul Gandhi, will sit across the table in the collegium to finalise names for key posts of the Election Commissioners, CBI Director, Chief Vigilance Commissioner and the National Human Rights Commission Chairperson.\n\nThough the two are supposed to counter each other, but on several issues concerning the nation, there has to be unanimity among all the parties. The Prime Minister, in his first speech in the Lok Sabha, mocked Rahul Gandhi, recalling how he had come to hug him on an earlier occasion. Gone are the days when political opponents used to be dignified even in their attacks, but now they choose to confront more openly and boldly, hoping to get applause from their own colleagues. The more brazenly you hurl brickbats at your opponents, the more publicity you would draw from the media.\n\nHaving realised that defeating BJP is not a big deal, the Congress leadership has become active as never before. Rahul Gandhi, it seems, has taken up the challenge upon himself for revitalising the party. To rejuvenate the party in the election-going States of Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra, he held several rounds of talks with the senior leaders of the party from the respective States. After donning the mantle of Leader of the Opposition, he has visited the trouble-torn State of Manipur, went to his own constituency of Rae Bareli, met with the aggrieved farmers in Lucknow and has been busy attending to the party work. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned the INDIA bloc by terming the Congress as Parasite, the SP, NCP, TMC, RJD, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and its other Allies are enjoying the new incarnation of Rahul Gandhi as the vociferous Leader of Opposition in Parliament. They have realised that it is only he who is fearless in his approach towards Prime Minister Modi and goes to any extent in embarrassing him. The entire INDIA bloc was cheering Rahul Gandhi while he was taking on the BJP Government left, right and centre. He, himself, was enjoying his own speech and asked the media persons later whether they too liked it.\n\nRahul Gandhi has been ridiculed and attacked not only by the BJP but also by the Congress Allies in the past. Right from Sharad Pawar, who advised him to tour the entire country, to Mamata Banerjee, who is opposed to his becoming the Prime Minister and prefers Mallikarjun Kharge, instead, Rahul Gandhi has faced immense humiliation. However, credit goes to him that he has earned the place for himself as the Leader of Opposition. It is due to his sheer hard work and discipline that he embarked on the two toughest yatras that have brought him closer to the common man.\n\nWhat he needs now is seriousness in his approach to counter the Treasury Benches. He has to be accurate on his facts and witty in his rebuttals, to confront the Modi government. The Budget Session of Parliament, commencing from July 22, will be another test for him to show his calibre and pin down the Government on the burning issues of the economy that confronts the nation.\n\nThere are vital issues that need attention, starting from unemployment, farmers' unrest, inflation, caste census, Manipur violence, rising terrorist incidents in J&K, besides others. One expects that rather than shouting down the Treasury Benches, the Opposition would engage in serious and valuable debates, to expose the BJP Government. The task of the LOP is not only to provoke the Government, but also to guide the MPs to take Parliament seriously and to ensure that the business is conducted on a regular basis. Now that the numerical strength of the Opposition has increased, they have a responsibility to ensure that Parliament is conducted on a regular basis.\n\n(The writer is Delhi-based senior journalist and political commentator.

Firstly,...\n\nBy all accounts, the 2023 Assembly elections in the state of Karnataka was historic. Not in the least for the stunning verdict it delivered. Firstly, stats reveal that the voting percentage of 73.84\n\nrecorded during the May 2023 polls was the highest ever in the State. Then, when it comes to the result, its impact was felt heavily by the saffron party candidates who were swept out ruthlessly by the state voters.\n\nFor the Congress, who were in turn warmly welcomed back to the centrestage of political power, the elections saw their vote share increasing and most importantly, the 135 seats they won ( out of a total of 224) was their best-ever performance at the hustings.\n\nWith such a heady return to the mainstream, one would have expected a perky political outfit to immediately settle down and consolidate its gains. Well, for the Congress, the popular adage fits to the T: The more the things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nHaving benefitted hugely from Rahul's Bharat Jodo Yatra which resonated well with the Kannadiga public, over the past one year, with continuous factional politics, communal skirmishes and the shadow-boxing between the top two - Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Dy CM, D K Shiva Kumar- the momentum seems to have dissipated.\n\nIn any case, in the recent Lok Sabha elections, the effect of Congressism was seen in the outcome when within a year after returning to power, the party couldn't manage to convert its goodwill into successful seats across the State. BJP was dented when it had to be content with 17 (in 2019, it had bagged 25) but still it emerged as the top party with alliance partner Janata Dal (Secular) adding its own share of two seats.\n\nWith the five guarantee schemes announced to woo the public across classes and genders proving to be a bottomless pit of sorts as far as financial allocations go, the hikes in petrol prices, milk prices etc have already started affecting the common people.\n\nAdded to that is the power politics on who should be the next CM. With both the factions\n\nrefusing to let go, the High Command has had to step in many a time to keep things in shape in the past months. Once again, the one-upmanship between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar has hogged media attention and it threatens to disturb the equilibrium which was accidentally in place all these days.\n\nThe overwhelming presence of Mutt heads, with each caste having a Swamiji to espouse their cause, the war is out in the open between the top two caste groups - the Lingayats and the Vokkaligas. Having shared power almost equally all these years, once again the clamour for the top slot for one of them has attained a momentum of its own.\n\nWhat is notable is that despite the secular nature of governance which the GOP espouses, it is strongly under the influence of a multitude of caste bosses who openly canvass for their own representative. While it is understandable that an overtly religious party like the BJP would heed to their counsel, the Congress has not shown any intent to stay away from being influenced by their pronouncements and appeals.\n\nWith Congress leaders raising the 'Operation Kamala', (the euphemism for BJP's efforts to break their party) bogey now and then, politics in the southern state is likely to be continuously on the boil with two squabbling seniors at the top and a set of turncoats and opportunists waiting for their turn next."""

387,387,"b'Hyderabad: Farmers\' bodies are seeking revival of the earlier system when a three-member committee used to visit mandals and districts to determine the reasons behind farmers\' deaths by suicide. This process was practically stopped after the BRS government announced the Rythu Bima scheme on August 15, 2018.\n\nRythu Bima pays Rs 5 lakh compensation to the family of the farmer who has died by suicide. The insurance scheme considered land ownership as the eligibility criterion and left out landless tenant farmers.\n\nAfter Rythu Bima was introduced, the system of verification at the mandal level by a team comprising a tahsildar, mandal agriculture officer and a sub-inspector as mandated by GO 194 to visit families of farmers who ended their lives, was given the go by. The subsequent verification saw the aggrieved families get a compensation of Rs 6 lakh.\n\nFarmer unions say that abandoning that system meant that the government would remain clueless about the actual reasons for the death of farmers.\n\nOf the 4,000 farmers who ended their lives after the formation of Telangana, families of only 1,600 received compensation.\n\n""We had to take the BRS government to court challenging this situation and ensured payments for some families. Cases on the issue continue to gather dust in the courts even as families await justice,"" said B. Kondal Reddy of Rythu Swarajya Vedika.\n\n""With around 136 farmers ending their lives in the last six months of whom 42 are tenant farmers there is a need to revive the old system. This was promised even by Rahul Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra. The government should this time ensure that visits by officials happen in time. Ex gratia was rejected by committees earlier on pretexts that the farmer had ended his or her life owing to family disputes, debts incurred for education or marriage of children or showing lack of tenancy agreement by tenant farmers.

388,388,"b""The 2024 Lok Sabha elections would be historic for many reasons. One of the biggest, after the extraordinary return to power of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a third term, would be the unimpeachable rise of Rahul Gandhi as a mass leader in his own right, without depending on his Nehru-Gandhi family legacy.\n\nFor nearly 20 years, since he made his political debut as a Lok Sabha member, through the decade of the UPA and then the 10 years of Narendra Modi's first two terms, Rahul Gandhi was criticised, condemned and ridiculed for his lack of connection with ground realities in the country because of his highly-protected upbringing. Moreover, there was a concerted attempt to write him off as a failure, and a narrative that portrayed him, sometimes unfairly, as the most discredited person in the country's politics, someone not to be taken seriously, sustained for over 10 years.\n\nEven Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claims to have been the most detested person in the media during his multi-term chief ministership of Gujarat, might not have faced such a massive smear campaign.\n\nWith the BJP rising under Mr Modi to becoming an omnipotent political force in India, any other person in the place of Rahul Gandhi would have taken political sanyas.\n\nHowever, Rahul confronted such a vicious campaign bravely. He did not allow despondency to set in even as his key lieutenants left the Congress Party for various reasons and perks.\n\nHe slowly worked on rejuvenating the Congress, at a time it was plumbing its worst depths. When all else failed, he reached out to the people directly through the Bharat Jodo Yatra. This polished him up like a diamond and helped him emerge as the Leader of Opposition, a constitutional position, the first he has accepted in his over-20-year-long political career.\n\nHad he accepted any position of power during the tenure of the UPA-1 and UPA-2 governments, it would have been a dynastic transition. However, as Rahul Gandhi took the difficult route, he has rightly earned his new position. Today he remains the only leader who did not mince his words when it came to opposing the government's policies, something that the Opposition is expected to do instead of cutting deals with the party in power.\n\nStrong punitive action in lawsuits, disqualification from the Parliament, and even forcible eviction from his residence, did not deter him.\n\nInstead, it helped him to become a real leader, one who could influence the country's politics in the decades to come.\n\nWith a strong base for the Opposition, and the return of coalition politics in the country, Mr Rahul Gandhi is ready for his role and responsibility. And the country awaits his rise to greater heights."""
389,389,"b'It would not be wrong to say that Rahul Gandhi has now more than arrived. His decision to take over as the Leader of the Opposition in\n\nthe Lok Sabha is bad news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has always targeted the Opposition by hook or crook over the past decade.\n\nRahul Gandhi being in the vanguard of the Opposition assault in Parliament is a signal that ""business as usual"" will not do for the Modi 3.0 government when the INDIA grouping is 237 strong, just three short of the BJP in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe decision meant the 54-year-old leader would bat from the front when the Opposition needed a Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and K. Srikanth, all put together. What the Opposition is facing is consistent bodyline bowling. It is sheer menacing as well as mean. It is not cricket.\n\nWith Om Birla being made the Speaker for the second time, the obstacles are not over for the effective functioning of the Opposition, to say the least. But that is also a test for Mr Gandhi and the entire Opposition to improvise, adapt and overcome.\n\nOne thing is clear. Prime Minister Modi wanted the most dependable guy as the presiding officer at a time when the Anti-Defection Act gives him tremendous powers.\n\nFor the Opposition, Mr Gandhi is the best bet, having seen it and gone through it all. The worst and the best. The high tide and the low tide. He must have been the most abused, trolled, ridiculed and humiliated leader in Independent India.\n\nMr Gandhi stands vindicated at such a time when the challenges before the Opposition have not diminished a bit despite the INDIA grouping securing 237 seats, just three short of the BJP. Mr Modi is too sharp, shrewd and cunning.\n\nPrashant Kishor, not exactly an admirer of Rahul or that of the Congress, had recently remarked in admiration about Mr Gandhi\'s grit and determination in the past decade to keep going despite consistent debacles on the electoral front. If it was Mr Modi in Rahul\'s place, he would have given up long back, Kishor suggested in a rare compliment.\n\nOne good thing in the new Lok Sabha is that Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav is also there and the Trinamul Congress firebrand, Mahua Moitra, is back with a renewed resolve. Akhilesh and Rahul, the ""Do Ladke"" of Uttar Pradesh, had performed creditably in the BJP\'s bastion and India\'s largest state, much to the shock of the Prime Minister and home minister Amit Shah.\n\nWe are now living in an unusual time when those in power are hailing India as the ""mother of democracy"" in international forums, but back home all powers are being used to see that the Opposition alliance is not referred to as ""INDIA"" by most of the media.\n\nTimes change. Those who project themselves as the outstanding leaders of their times are found with ""feet of clay"" even by their cheerleaders.\n\nBut the times just don\'t pass like that and the challenge has to be met squarely, fully, and wholly.\n\nIt is no child\'s play when the entire system is operated to project the ""One Nation, One Leader"" idea, however anathema in a democracy.\n\nWhat is of prime importance is to have greater cohesion, cooperation and camaraderie within the Opposition to shake off any possible or real threats, as also a deep strategy to keep the Modi government off balance, a job easier said than done.\n\nWhat Rahul Gandhi needs in abundance is patience, perseverance and a powerful team of advisers from the Opposition ranks that would help to have a competitive advantage over those in power, who have the confrontationist streak to the core.\n\nThe Opposition needs to realise that the Modi-Shah duo have politics on their mind 24x7 and therefore it is necessary to understand their psyche.\n\nSo, Mr Gandhi would need a strategy all the more to take the battle to the BJP turf as an impatient Modi will do everything possible to become his own man by securing a majority.\n\nRahul Gandhi will have too much on his platter as he navigates the Opposition ship in choppy waters. Those in authority are past masters in the game of divide and rule and in no time they will use their tricks to break/split the non-BJP parties with the precision of a skilled surgeon. Resources are not a problem.\n\nThe ""Gujarat model"" to subjugate the Opposition will be in force in much greater vigour, but subtly and silently and it will be a minefield all around for those minding the Opposition flock.\n\nOne good thing is that Mr Gandhi has seen it all. Those who to a certain extent read right the inscrutable mind of Mr Modi feel that he is most uncomfortable with Rahul Gandhi and his unusual ways. The Bharat Jodo Yatra and its sequel must have stunned Mr Modi, who has publicly sought to ignore the novel outreach.\n\nIt is not for nothing that the ""Pappu"" campaign was launched long ago and was carried forward with great gusto by the faithful. The design was obvious. Demoralise your opponent to such an extent so that he does not turn deadly.\n\nInterestingly, Mr Modi is showing that he might be heading a coalition, but still he is the same old ""strong"" leader. The words ""accommodation"" and ""adjustment"" do not exist in his dictionary.\n\nIt will be a half battle won for Mr Gandhi when the treasury benches felt that Mr Modi, dubbed by them as a strong leader, was facing difficulties in dealing with the Leader of the Opposition, with a never-say-die spirit.\n\nThese are early days. But the fact is that Mr Modi cannot take things for granted as in the past. The Opposition is sizing up the PM and will call him to account sooner than later. In the new Lok Sabha, he will have to show that he is a good parliamentarian, from answering questions in the Question Hour to helping his ministers to put up a good show. It is not enough to be just a good orator and be pleased with the chants hailing him. The times have changed.\n\nThe vigorous Opposition will be there to make him uneasy in every way. A political commentator put it best: The Prime Minister will be the most uncomfortable man in the new Lok Sabha.'"

396,396,"b'New Delhi: Rahul Gandhi\'s decision to accept the Congress Working Committee\'s (CWC) offer to become the new Leader of the Opposition in Parliament may serve a dual purpose. Firstly, he will be armed with a statutory position under the law, positioning himself as a direct rival to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2029 elections, compelling Modi to take him seriously unlike in the past. Secondly, despite being the strongest critic of the Prime Minister both inside and outside Parliament, Gandhi\'s voice has often been drowned out by the BJP\'s ""shouting brigade"" over the past decade. However, this scenario is poised to change as the BJP enters the Lok Sabha with a reduced strength of 240 MPs, down from 303 in the previous Lok Sabha.\n\nIn contrast, the Congress has almost doubled its strength, increasing from 52 to 102 MPs, including three independents. This bolstered presence will enable the Congress to counter the BJP\'s tactics more effectively. A tit-for-tat subtleties and intricacies might emerge in Parliament: if the BJP\'s ""shouting brigade"" attempts to silence Rahul Gandhi as Congress MPs may reciprocate by disrupting the Prime Minister\'s speeches.\n\nThe overall parliamentary balance of power has shifted as well. The combined strength of the NDA (BJP and its allies) will be reduced to 294, down from 336 in the previous regime. Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA has increased its seats from 90 to 234, including several new additions, which is bound to pose a significant challenge for the ruling party.\n\nHistory Repeats Itself\n\nIndira Gandhi as ""Goongi Gudiya"" and Her Grandson as ""Pappu"" and ""Shehzada""\n\nAn amended version of Karl Marx\'s quote suggests that history repeats itself first as tragedy and not necessarily as a farce hence its recurrence has ended up in the form of enhanced prestige for Rahul Gandhi as LOP. It doubly holds true to Rahul whose ascendancy is the by-product of untiring struggle and societal complexities. Political observers point out two stark similarities between the late Mrs. Indira Gandhi\'s comeback in 1980 and Rahul Gandhi\'s recent resurgence.\n\nIndira Gandhi earned the title ""Bechari"" in the eyes of the people due to the excesses and humiliation inflicted on her by the Janata Party after losing power, a fallout of the Emergency\'s dark era. In the late 1960s, she was derisively called ""Goongi Gudiya"" (Dumb Doll) by her detractors, which ultimately helped in her emergence as a stronger leader besides bouncing back to power in 1980. Similarly, Rahul Gandhi\'s rejuvenation as a credible LOP in 2024 comes after being dubbed ""Pappu"" by the BJP and vilification campaign went unabated for over a decade.\n\nRahul Gandhi Shed\'s Stigma Through Bharat Jodo Yatra\n\nRahul seized a golden opportunity to shed this stigma during his 4,080-kilometer \'Bharat Jodo Yatra\' from Kanyakumari to Jammu and Kashmir over 150 days. He focused on winning the hearts of the common people, alleging that BJP leaders spent hundreds of crores on a relentless campaign to denigrate him because they perceived him as a future challenger to Modi. He asserted that the majority of TV channels, newspapers, and social media platforms were part of this conspiracy.\n\nDuring this ordeal journey, Rahul Gandhi highlighted his personal struggle thereby emphasizing that investigative agencies, at the behest of the Prime Minister, had been harassing him, going so far as to grill him continuously for 50 hours without finding anything. He lambasted the Modi government for ignoring the woes of common people, village distress, rising inequalities, farmers\' rights to a Minimum Support Price for their produce, youth unemployment, skyrocketing prices of essential commodities, and the undermining of constitutional bodies. He accused the Modi government of being indifferent to these issues while top NDA leaders sat in air-conditioned rooms in Delhi.\n\nAt this juncture, experts suggest that the common people witnessed a privileged member of the Gandhi family walking in scorching heat and biting cold, highlighting their problems. This might have changed their opinion about him, leading them to perceive him as a ""Bechara Shehzada"" (Poor Prince), earning their sympathy and contributing to the BJP\'s undoing in the 2024 polls. The NDA government\'s focus on Hindutva, anti-Muslim rhetoric, and tall promises failed to address people\'s real issues. Prime Minister Modi can be credited for popularizing the term ""Shehzada"" (Scion) for Rahul Gandhi, but this campaign ultimately transformed his image from ""Pappu"" to a credible national leader.\n\nOvercoming the Derision of ""Pappu"" and its Genesis\n\nRahul Gandhi, a prominent figure in Indian politics, has faced significant challenges on his distressed journey to becoming a credible leader of the opposition. Despite the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\'s concerted efforts to undermine his reputation by dubbing him with the derogatory nickname ""Pappu,"" Gandhi has demonstrated resilience and growth as a political leader.\n\nThe term ""Pappu,"" used pejoratively to suggest incompetence, has been a persistent tool in the BJP\'s campaign to discredit Gandhi. This nickname, amplified by media and social platforms, sought to paint him as a dilettante lacking the gravitas to lead. However, Gandhi\'s response to this smear campaign has been multifaceted and strategic.\n\nSome senior journalists based in Delhi attribute the origin of ""Pappu"" to ex-AAP leader and poet, Kumar Vishwas, who contested against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi in 2014. However, some critics of the BJP suggest that the derogatory term was coined by the late Arun Jaitley, an intelligent and influential member of the BJP think tank. It is an irony of circumstances that despite UPA1 being in power, the Delhi Election Commission ran an ad campaign in the 2009 parliamentary polls which said, ""Pappu cannot vote,"" aiming to motivate voters. At that juncture, the UPA government was in power and could have potentially intervened through the Election Commission, which was perceived as being loyal to the ruling party at that time, similar to the current situation.\n\nThe 2007 movie ""Pappu Paas Ho Gaya"" introduced the character of an innocent boy labelled as dumb, and the 2010 film ""Pappu Can\'t Dance Saala"" reinforced the BJP\'s derogatory connotation aimed at tarnishing Rahul Gandhi\'s image. This narrative persisted for over a decade. The nickname ""Pappu"" stuck to Rahul Gandhi, and the BJP\'s IT cell further propagated this image, particularly after mocking his speech at the Confederation of Indian Industry on April 13, 2013, which led to the top trending Twitter topic #PappuCII.\n\nAmit Shah also taunted Rahul as ""Pappu"" during the October 2013 campaign, accusing Congress of positioning him as the prime ministerial candidate out of fear of losing the polls, while asserting that Narendra Modi had the people\'s blessings. Despite this, the BJP\'s efforts faltered after the conclusion of two Yatras and the Congress party\'s improved performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections, which saw their tally double to 99 seats. Rahul Gandhi\'s resilience and strategic responses have begun to shift public perception, allowing him to emerge as a more credible and formidable leader in the Indian political landscape.\n\nChallenges As Leader Of The Opposition\n\nAs the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Parliament, he will face numerous challenges that will require him to be a dedicated and full-time, 24x7, leader to face Modi who has got all established credentials and ingredients of hard working and committed leadership. The role cannot be discharged on an ad hoc basis as it will demand continuous effort and strategic planning.\n\nKey Responsibilities and Strategies include regular Interaction with Allies: Gandhi must engage regularly with leaders of allied parties to formulate strategies aimed at cornering the weakened BJP-led alliance in Parliament. Building and maintaining strong relationships with diverse political groups will be mandatory.\n\nAggressive yet Mature Approach is essential: It will be a litmus and crucial test of Gandhi to demonstrate aggression balanced with maturity, particularly when highlighting issues of public importance. His ability to address these issues effectively in Parliament will be a key factor in his success.\n\nUnifying a Fragmented Opposition will be a difficult task: One of the most significant challenges will be unifying a fragmented opposition. The diverse political ideologies and regional interests create a complex landscape, making consensus-building a critical yet difficult task.\n\nCountering the Ruling Party\'s Narrative is important: Despite the BJP\'s reduced majority, countering its dominant narrative remains a formidable challenge. The ruling party\'s stronghold on media and public perception necessitates a strategic and compelling united opposition narrative.\n\nScrutiny of diplomatic and flexible Leadership Style to win confidence of alliance partners: Gandhi\'s leadership style and communication skills are under constant scrutiny. Establishing his credibility and demonstrating robust leadership in parliamentary debates and public forums are crucial for gaining public trust and support.\n\nResponsibilities As Leader Of The Opposition\n\nHolding the Government Accountable with logic and facts: Gandhi will lead the opposition\'s efforts in holding the government accountable. This involves articulating the opposition\'s stance on various issues, participating in debates, and ensuring effective representation.\n\nRallying Opposition Parties: He will need to rally opposition parties, build consensus, and coordinate their efforts. This can be challenging given the diverse ideologies and interests of different parties.\n\nEffective Communication is of paramount relevance: Gandhi must develop a penetrating and mature skill to communicate effectively within and outside Parliament. His speeches, statements, and interactions with the media will shape public perception and influence political discourse.\n\nStrategic Decision-Making: Making strategic decisions regarding when to cooperate with the ruling party and when to oppose them requires astute political judgment. Balancing these choices will be crucial. Mastery of Parliamentary Procedures will include the understanding parliamentary rules, procedures, and tactics which are essential. Gandhi will need to master these to effectively challenge the government. Raising Critical Issues as common people expect the LoP to raise critical issues, propose alternatives, and offer constructive solutions. Meeting these expectations will be key to Gandhi\'s effectiveness as LoP.\n\nLegal Challenges\n\nRahul Gandhi also faces legal cases, including defamation charges. Navigating these legal hurdles while fulfilling his responsibilities as LoP will require careful management and resilience. Impact on India\'s Political Landscape.\n\nRahul may get an important post of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, which primarily examines reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) .PAC has got a majority of nominees of the government hence it typically decides issues by vote. In addition to this, LOP would be part of various collegiums alongside the Prime Minister and Chief Justice of India (or government nominees), responsible for selecting the heads of key investigative and transparency agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Lokpal, Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), Chief Election Commissioner/Election Commissioners, and Chief Information Commissioner (CIC).\n\nAnalysts opine that political exigencies dictate the course of events in politics. Imagine a scenario when two fierce critics of each will sit on one table to select the heads of CVC, CBI, CEC and commissioners, LOKPAL, etc. which may end up in consensus as the ruling party always prevails owing to majority in these committees. It will require mutual respect, reasoning and adoption of the principle of \'Give and Take\' to cement better bonds between PM and LOP otherwise consequences will be regrettable and deplorable.\n\nOverall, Rahul Gandhi\'s leadership as LoP will significantly impact India\'s political landscape. To effectively represent the opposition in Parliament, he will have to rise to these challenges, demonstrating strong leadership and a commitment to address the concerns of the people of India.'"
397,397,"b'Congress MP Rahul Gandhi arrives for the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha, in New Delhi on Wednesday, April 27, 2024. | ANI\n\nRahul Gandhi\'s decision to accept the Congress Working Committee\'s (CWC) offer to become the new Leader of the Opposition in Parliament may serve a dual purpose. Firstly, he will be armed with a statutory position under the law, positioning himself as a direct rival to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2029 elections, compelling Modi to take him seriously unlike in the past. Secondly, despite being the strongest critic of the Prime Minister both inside and outside Parliament, Gandhi\'s voice has often been drowned out by the BJP\'s ""shouting brigade"" over the past decade. However, this scenario is poised to change as the BJP enters the Lok Sabha with a reduced strength of 240 MPs, down from 303 in the previous Lok Sabha.\n\nIn contrast, the Congress has almost doubled its strength, increasing from 52 to 102 MPs, including three independents. This bolstered presence will enable the Congress to counter the BJP\'s tactics more effectively. A tit-for-tat subtleties and intricacies might emerge in Parliament: if the BJP\'s ""shouting brigade"" attempts to silence Rahul Gandhi as Congress MPs may reciprocate by disrupting the Prime Minister\'s speeches.\n\nThe overall parliamentary balance of power has shifted as well. The combined strength of the NDA (BJP and its allies) will be reduced to 294, down from 336 in the previous regime. Meanwhile, the Congress-led UPA has increased its seats from 90 to 234, including several new additions, which is bound to pose a significant challenge for the ruling party.\n\nIndira Gandhi As \'Goongi Gudiya\' & Her Grandson As \'Pappu\', \'Shehzada\'\n\nAn amended version of Karl Marx\'s quote suggests that history repeats itself first as tragedy and not necessarily as a farce hence its recurrence has ended up in the form of enhanced prestige for Rahul Gandhi as LOP. It doubly holds true to Rahul whose ascendancy is the by-product of untiring struggle and societal complexities. Political observers point out two stark similarities between the late Mrs. Indira Gandhi\'s comeback in 1980 and Rahul Gandhi\'s recent resurgence.\n\nIndira Gandhi earned the title ""Bechari"" in the eyes of the people due to the excesses and humiliation inflicted on her by the Janata Party after losing power, a fallout of the Emergency\'s dark era. In the late 1960s, she was derisively called ""Goongi Gudiya"" (Dumb Doll) by her detractors, which ultimately helped in her emergence as a stronger leader besides bouncing back to power in 1980. Similarly, Rahul Gandhi\'s rejuvenation as a credible LOP in 2024 comes after being dubbed ""Pappu"" by the BJP and vilification campaign went unabated for over a decade.\n\nRahul seized a golden opportunity to shed this stigma during his 4,080-kilometer \'Bharat Jodo Yatra\' from Kanyakumari to Jammu and Kashmir over 150 days. He focused on winning the hearts of the common people, alleging that BJP leaders spent hundreds of crores on a relentless campaign to denigrate him because they perceived him as a future challenger to Modi. He asserted that the majority of TV channels, newspapers, and social media platforms were part of this conspiracy.\n\nDuring this ordeal journey, Rahul Gandhi highlighted his personal struggle thereby emphasizing that investigative agencies, at the behest of the Prime Minister, had been harassing him, going so far as to grill him continuously for 50 hours without finding anything. He lambasted the Modi government for ignoring the woes of common people, village distress, rising inequalities, farmers\' rights to a Minimum Support Price for their produce, youth unemployment, skyrocketing prices of essential commodities, and the undermining of constitutional bodies. He accused the Modi government of being indifferent to these issues while top NDA leaders sat in air-conditioned rooms in Delhi.\n\nAt this juncture, experts suggest that the common people witnessed a privileged member of the Gandhi family walking in scorching heat and biting cold, highlighting their problems. This might have changed their opinion about him, leading them to perceive him as a ""Bechara Shehzada"" (Poor Prince), earning their sympathy and contributing to the BJP\'s undoing in the 2024 polls. The NDA government\'s focus on Hindutva, anti-Muslim rhetoric, and tall promises failed to address people\'s real issues. Prime Minister Modi can be credited for popularizing the term ""Shehzada"" (Scion) for Rahul Gandhi, but this campaign ultimately transformed his image from ""Pappu"" to a credible national leader.\n\nOvercoming Derision Of \'Pappu\' & Its Genesis\n\nRahul Gandhi, a prominent figure in Indian politics, has faced significant challenges on his distressed journey to becoming a credible leader of the opposition. Despite the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\'s concerted efforts to undermine his reputation by dubbing him with the derogatory nickname ""Pappu,"" Gandhi has demonstrated resilience and growth as a political leader. The term ""Pappu,"" used pejoratively to suggest incompetence, has been a persistent tool in the BJP\'s campaign to discredit Gandhi. This nickname, amplified by media and social platforms, sought to paint him as a dilettante lacking the gravitas to lead. However, Gandhi\'s response to this smear campaign has been multifaceted and strategic.\n\nSome senior journalists based in Delhi attribute the origin of ""Pappu"" to ex-AAP leader and poet, Kumar Vishwas, who contested against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi in 2014. However, some critics of the BJP suggest that the derogatory term was coined by the late Arun Jaitley, an intelligent and influential member of the BJP think tank. It is an irony of circumstances that despite UPA1 being in power, the Delhi Election Commission ran an ad campaign in the 2009 parliamentary polls which said, ""Pappu cannot vote,"" aiming to motivate voters. At that juncture, the UPA government was in power and could have potentially intervened through the Election Commission, which was perceived as being loyal to the ruling party at that time, similar to the current situation.\n\nThe 2007 movie ""Pappu Paas Ho Gaya"" introduced the character of an innocent boy labelled as dumb, and the 2010 film ""Pappu Can\'t Dance Saala"" reinforced the BJP\'s derogatory connotation aimed at tarnishing Rahul Gandhi\'s image. This narrative persisted for over a decade. The nickname ""Pappu"" stuck to Rahul Gandhi, and the BJP\'s IT cell further propagated this image, particularly after mocking his speech at the Confederation of Indian Industry on April 13, 2013, which led to the top trending Twitter topic #PappuCII. Amit Shah also taunted Rahul as ""Pappu"" during the October 2013 campaign, accusing Congress of positioning him as the prime ministerial candidate out of fear of losing the polls, while asserting that Narendra Modi had the people\'s blessings.

398,398,"b'Rahul Gandhi undertook the ambitious Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Srinagar through the slogan, ""Nafrat ke bazaar mein, mohabbat ki dukaan"" | File/ANI\n\nRahul Gandhi made his electoral debut from Amethi in 2004. A reluctant politician, I still remember how driving from the Lucknow airport to Amethi, it was Priyanka Gandhi who was goading him on to wave more aggressively to the crowds milling on both sides of the road showering rose petals on the brother-sister duo.\n\nHe went on to win Amethi but he remained an indifferent politician as was obvious when he made a high- profile visit to the two adjacent villages of Bhatta Parsaul near Greater Noida in May 2011. The villages had witnessed widespread farmers\' protests in May 2011 when their land was being forcibly acquired by the Mayawati state government. Police firing resulted in the death of two farmers, and 40-year old Rahul Gandhi arrived there four days later to get a first hand impression of what happened. I was part of the press contingent who covered his visit. The farmers were not particularly enthused by his presence only because they felt that he had done little during his six-year tenure in Parliament to gain their confidence. Several farmers saw him as a dynast who enjoyed power without a sense of commitment.\n\nWe are now witnessing a turbocharged Rahul Gandhi, who has finally agreed to accept the constitutional post of the Leader of Opposition in Parliament with cabinet rank allowing him to select parliamentary committees and also be part of selection committees that decide heads of crucial institutions including the CBI, CVC, CIC, EC and the NHRC.\n\nIn his new avatar, he is reaching out to the people, conveying to the public at large that here is a leader who is willing to show concern and compassion for the problems that they are afflicted by.\n\nHe visited Hathras on July 5 to meet the families of victims of the victims of a stampede that caused the death of more than 121 lives. His trip, stopping at Aligarh to commiserate and provide support with two families who lived there, and then went on to write a letter to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath asking him to provide the affected families the ""best possible compensation"". He was the first senior Opposition leader to visit the site where the accident occurred.\n\nJust prior to his visit to Hathras, he went to Gujarat where a Congress office had been attacked and party workers attacked following his comments during his reply to Motion of Thanks to President\'s address in Parliament that the BJP do not have a monopoly over Hindu religion, that ""aap Hindu ho hi nahi"". His speech triggered a political firestorm as he accused the BJP of spreading ""violence, hatred and lies"" which were against the basic tenets of Hinduism. During his Gujarat visit, Gandhi gave a clarion call that in the next round of elections, the Congress would sweep Gujarat as they had won Ayodhya. It was obvious that he was willing to take the fight right into the lion\'s den.\n\nDuring the last 10 years, Gandhi has been consistent in his criticism of the BJP-RSS combine and the brand of poisonous Hindutva they have spread. It has been an uphill battle for him during which period he has been a victim of cruel jokes and crude propaganda. In order to offset his ""Pappu"" image, he undertook the ambitious Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Srinagar through the slogan, ""Nafrat ke bazaar mein, mohabbat ki dukaan"". This was followed by the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Mumbai which focused on social justice. There was no shortage of naysayers insisting that he should have focused on strengthening the Congress party, but these yatras did succeed in presenting us a persona of a decent and accessible leader who provided a softer alternative to Modi\'s muscular nationalism. During this lengthy walkathon, he did not hesitate to pass the mike around to the public in order to listen to their comments and grievances.\n\nNext, he paid a day-long visit to Manipur where ethnic violence between Meitei and Kuki communities has claimed more than 200 lives since May last year. This was Rahul\'s third visit, a contrast to the prime minister who has still to visit the state. Gandhi lost no opportunity at taking a dig at Modi urging him to visit this strife-torn state and offer some solace to the people.\n\nHe seems determined to become the ""people\'s politician"". Whether it be meeting Agniveer victims or visiting the New Delhi railway station to meet aggrieved locomotive drivers in order to understand first hand their grievances, he is willing to hear different points of view unlike Modi who only believes talking down to the public.\n\nHe also made a high profile visit to his constituency of Rae Bareli on July 9 where he met the family of a solider killed in Siachen and offered prayers at a Hanuman temple. The temple visit was significant because the BJP had put up posters and banners across the city questioning him on his religious identity and whether he considered his Hindu voters to be violent.\n\nDuring the last year, Rahul Gandhi has been trying to create a new social base by reaching out to the Dalit and OBC vote bank. This is true across all parties and there is little doubt that the OBC representation in the 18th Lok Sabha has increased from 23% to 26% matching that of the upper caste representation. Dalit representation has increased from 15.8% to 16.2% while Adivasis represented a minor increase from 10.3% to 10.7%.\n\nSuccess for the Congress party can only come about if they pay much greater attention to two key issues. The BJP may have lost 20% of the seats it had won in 2019, but it has lost only 0.8% of its vote share. The CSDA-Lokniti post poll survey points out that despite ten years of anti-Muslim bashing and an autocratic rule, the BJP in 2024 still succeeded in garnering a vote share amounting to 23.59 crore which is 70 lakh more votes than it did in 2019 when it received a vote share of 37.36% of vote share which was 22.9 crore voters. No doubt the Congress vote share increased from 19% to 21.5% even though it contested only 100 seats but the fact is that much more work needs to be done on the ground to break the stranglehold of Hindutva ideology.\n\nThe other crucial problem will be just how the Congress party will deal with their regional allies. Rahul is known to consult very few people and is often known to take impulsive decisions. He cannot afford to forget that what he says and does will have a bearing on other political parties.\n\nThe upcoming state elections will go a long way in proving what impact his initiatives have had on the ground. There is little doubt that the BJP has reached saturation point in states of Chattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh. Success in the upcoming elections in Haryana and in several other assembly elections will go a long way in helping reinforcing Gandhi\'s leadership and that of his regional allies. Already the present Congress leadership seems to have pushed the party to the left and it is hardly seen as a centrist, upper-caste party any more. Gandhi will need to take all factions together and that will require much more skill than he has shown so far.\n\nThe job of keeping the INDIA alliance will prove a tricky one and what shape it will take in the days to come remains unclear. They need to keep it together in order to be able to fight Modi both inside and outside parliament.'"
399,399,"b'All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia. -- George Orwell\n\nOn August 9, the Home Minister, while attacking the Opposition in Parliament, said, ""What happened in Manipur is shameful, but to do politics over it is more shameful."" On June 5, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, in a soundbite after the Balasore train accident, said, ""The Opposition is trying to politicise this accident."" It is not difficult to trace a pattern of similar statements by prominent members of the ruling party after almost all the tragic events that made national news. For example, the tragedies that happened in Hathras, Kathua, and Lakhimpur Kheri were all followed by such statements by BJP functionaries, and they were pushed as the dominant narrative to the public by the mainstream and social media. In this way, public disasters and failures that are under the state\'s purview are shielded from any debate by excluding them from the sphere of political discourse; conversely, artificial controversies over non-existent threats and phenomena, such as ""love jihad"", the allegation that allocation of beds by the Bangalore municipal authority was being corruptly done by Muslim staffers, the conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was diffused through a Tablighi Jamat super-spreader event, and so on ad infinitum, take the space of the political mainstream.\n\nAlthough statements like these have been a part of political discourse in India for a long time, they became a political strategy in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes, which took place in February 2019, just a few months before the general elections, which the ruling party utilised to not only suppress questions and debates around the claims of its success but also to propagate their jingoistic hyper-nationalism. This strategy was very effective at killing two birds with one stone. Firstly, it was an ideological success that they were able to normalise the notion that certain subjects or situations are sacred and should not be politicised and that the public should blindly believe the official narrative emanating from the state; hence, the (in)action and intentions of the state and its institutions when dealing with these subjects or situations should not be questioned. Secondly, it was an electoral success, as the ruling party used this strategy to daub both the politicians from the opposition and the independent journalists who asked for accountability in the wake of this tragedy as immoral, anti-national, and mal-intentioned. This phenomenon is extremely alarming, as the idea that in any such situation the state is absolved from any reasonable accountability and scrutiny is extremely dangerous, especially for a democracy. The question that arises is: How did this strategy work so well?\n\nThe demonisation of the word ""politics"" began right after Independence and, over a period of time, became a part of popular culture and consciousness, implying that ""politics"" is de facto unethical. This can be described as the notion that asking for any level of accountability is equivalent to doing (unethical) politics and that the Opposition parties and the public at large should rather cooperate with the government and keep quiet in the face of such events. The emotional appeal that usually backs such rhetoric is so powerful that both the opposition parties and the general public have now begun to fall into this trap on their own. During a press conference that happened a few days after the pedestrian bridge collapse in Morbi, Gujarat, in which 141 people died, Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was asked about his stance on this mishap, replied, ""People have died there; I would not like to politicise this."" Simultaneously, social media trended with emotionally charged appeals to cooperate with the government and not politicise this, and abuses were directed at journalists and politicians who tried to question the authorities and the government. A similar narrative is propagated against citizens and politicians who question the role of institutions such as the armed forces and the police in the event of a communal clash or extrajudicial killings. Notably, these responses have now become voluntary and organic.\n\nIn addition, it harks back to what the Nazi legal theorist and philosopher Carl Schmitt stated in his work ""The Concept of the Political,"" where for Schmitt, the political is reducible to the existential difference between friend and foe. For Schmitt, conflict is an inescapable and embedded fact of human existence, and liberal or other ideological attempts to resolve or manage it are doomed to failure. The very fact of human diversity in identities, beliefs, and practices is what drives this conflict and necessitates dividing the world into friends and enemies. The institution that decides this, of course, is the sovereign, who alone has this authority and who cannot be questioned. Similarly, when it comes to public discourse, it is now the sovereign that decides what can be ""political"" or not, so that genuine issues of public interest are depoliticised instantly and any attempt to do so shut down, while very ordinary events are shamelessly politicised to serve the regime\'s ends.\n\nThe impact of this ideational propaganda is so deep that public groups and civil society appear to be either afraid of organising or participating in protests and demonstrations even in the case of life-threatening concerns, or, in some cases, when they do gather enough courage and motivation to come on to the streets, they either do not question the highest office or they brand their protest as something that is above ""petty"" politics, and hence political parties should not interfere. Examples of the former are the anti-GST protests that happened in Surat in 2017, and examples of the latter are the anti-CAA and anti-Farm Law protests, in which the opposition political parties were instructed not to visit the protest sites or use their stage for their political benefit. If we compare the nature and scale of these protests with the pre-2014 demonstrations, for example, the anti-corruption uprising and the protests that arose in the wake of Nirbhaya, the differences with respect to the willing participation of the citizenry and the absence of opposition leaders can be clearly seen. This tactic of the ruling party has significantly reduced the space for opposition politics, which in turn has resulted in their curtailed visibility and acceptance in the public.\n\nFor successful oppositional politics to combat this threat, there must be a refusal to accept the ordained terrain and conditions laid down by the ruling regime as to what can be politicised and what cannot, and to raise issues and debates that are of genuine interest and affect people\'s everyday lives. The recent Bharat Jodo Yatra can be seen as something that sought to do this very thing and that paid electoral dividends in the Karnataka assembly elections, where Congress managed to win a majority, dislodging the ruling BJP government in the state. Breaking the restrictions imposed on what can be subjected to politics and scrutiny is essential to this, as Orwell had warned: ""The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.""\n\nThis final, most essential command must be resisted.'"
400,400,"b'The Leader of Opposition accused the Sangh Parivar of distorting Hinduism, highlighted the exams mess, condemned attacks on the Constitution and criticised the govt\'s handling of Manipur and the farmers\' protests\n\nLeader of Opposition the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi took centre stage on Monday with a combative speech that amplified a range of critical issues. From Hinduism to the NEET exam, Gandhi\'s assertions were met with strong reactions -- against him and in support, respectively -- from the ruling BJP and his Congress party members. Here are five key points he raised:\n\nHinduism and BJP\'s ideology\n\nCongress MP Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha during ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. Rahul Gandhi opened his address on Monday in the Lok Sabha with a sharp critique of the ruling BJP, asserting that Hinduism is not about spreading fear, hatred and falsehoods. He held up a picture of Lord Shiva, emphasising that true Hinduism is about fearlessness and non-violence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi interrupted, arguing that calling the entire Hindu society violent is a serious matter. Rahul shot back: ""The BJP and the RSS are not the entire Hindu society.""\n\nNEET mess\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi speaks in the House during ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. Soon after the Lok Sabha session commenced, Rahul brought up the issue of irregularities in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission into medical courses. He demanded a dedicated discussion on the matter, claiming that over 2 crore students had been affected by multiple paper leaks. He asserted: ""Truth is NEET students do not believe in the exam, they think it\'s designed for rich students and not the meritorious.""\n\nBJP\'s attack against him\n\nCongress MP Rahul Gandhi speaks in the Lok Sabha during ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. Rahul accused the BJP of launching systematic attacks on the Constitution and the fundamental idea of India. He recounted personal experiences, including over 20 cases filed against him, his house being taken away, and 55 hours of interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate. It was nothing but of political vendetta, he declared. ""I was attacked on the orders of Prime Minister Modi,"" he claimed. On the Constitution, his jab was: ""It feels nice that BJP people are now repeating \'Jai Samvidhan\' after me.""\n\nFarmers\' protest\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi at a protest of INDIA bloc against the alleged misuse of probe agencies by the central government, during ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. The Congress MP from Rae Bareli criticised the government\'s approach to the farmers\' protests that have rocked the nation, calling out the ruling BJP\'s leaders\' labelling of protesting farmers as terrorists. He backed farmers\' demands such as guaranteed minimum support price and loan waivers and accused the government of ignoring the farmers\' plight.\n\nManipur Crisis\n\nLeader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi leaves after attending the ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. The prime minister and the home minister appeared unconcerned about the situation in Manipur, suggesting they did not consider it part of the country, Rahul declared. He highlighted the ongoing turmoil in the northeastern state and what he called the government\'s apparent apathy towards it.\n\nAgniveer scheme\n\nCongress MP and LoP Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha during the ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. Rahul dubbed the Agniveer scheme of temporrary recruitments into the army as ""use and throw"" labour. He likened its arbitrary implementation to demonetisation. He argued that the scheme discriminated among soldiers, noting that agniveers were neither accorded the status of martyrs if they lost their lives in war nor provided with pension. He drew on his experiences from the Bharat Jodo Yatra to underscore what he called the discontent among soldiers.\n\nAyodhya\n\nLok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi speaks in the House during ongoing Parliament session, in New Delhi, Monday, July 1, 2024. On Ayodhya, Gandhi pointed out the lack of compensation for residents displaced by the construction of the Ayodhya airport and surrounding infrastructure. He mentioned the displeasure of locals when industrialist ""Mr Adani"" was invited to the inauguration, but not the residents themselves.\n\nJab at Speaker\n\nRahul Gandhi also had a verbal exchange with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. Questioning Birla\'s impartiality, Gandhi remarked: ""You are the final arbiter of the Lok Sabha. What you say fundamentally defines Indian democracy."" He pointed out a perceived difference in respect, noting how Birla bowed to Prime Minister Modi but stood straight while shaking his -- Rahul\'s hand. The Speaker said he bowed to elders.'"
401,401,"b'Little over 18 months into the job, the youngest Prime Minister of Indian-origin to lead modern Britain faces a tough challenge to get the people\'s mandate and be the ""rightful occupant"" of No 10 Downing Street\n\nI would rather have lucky generals than good ones, is a quote attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, but it rather fits British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who is leading a battered Conservative Party into British elections.\n\nLittle over 18 months into the job, the youngest Prime Minister of Indian-origin\n\nto lead modern Britain faces a tough challenge to get the people\'s mandate and\n\nbe the ""rightful occupant"" of No 10 Downing Street.\n\nOdds are stacked against him as the Labour Party leads over the Conservatives\n\nacross all opinion polls by a comfortable margin of 20 points. The point of discussion\n\nis the scale of Labour win after 14 long years. Of the 365 Tory MP\'s who formed the\n\nlast government 75, including former Prime Minister Theresa May and former deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, have decided not to contest elections.\n\nDespite gloom written large over his political future, the diaspora from the subcontinent, not just India, look at Rishi with a lot of optimism.\n\n""When I see Rishi Sunak, I see hope"", says Imran Choudhary who hails from Bangladesh and is a councillor from West Northamptonshire. ""With him having\n\noccupied the top chair, in the coming years my great grandchildren can look up to\n\nRishi. So can I. Think of it, this means a lot to us South Asians,"" he adds.\n\nChoudhary dismisses the criticism levied against Sunak, that the cost of living has gone through the roof, the economy is in tatters, public services are taking a southward dip, especially the waiting lines at the National Health Services.\n\n""He inherited these problems and has done what any other PM would have. An emotional verdict on Brexit, followed by Covid shattered our ailing economy and Rishi has got it back on track. The inflation is under control and things are looking bright,"" says Choudhary.\n\nHis sentiments are echoed by Om Prakash Sharma hailing from Jammu, who is in\n\nthe real estate business. ""The interest rates were high at 5 per cent, the real estate\n\nsector was down, Rishi has been able to bring that down to under 4 per cent and things are looking up. Even inflation is down, but still, one hears about the cost of living\n\nbeing high, it\'s always been so in London.""\n\nIndians across the board are upbeat about Sunak, Jay U Shah, a businessman who\n\nhas been in Britain for over five decades, says: ""He is a good guy, with his heart at\n\nthe right place. Can\'t find much wrong with what he has done, had he worked on his\n\nmessaging, he would have been in a stronger place.""\n\nShah\'s views are furthered by a British national who doesn\'t wish to be named and\n\nhas worked for over five years in India before returning back earlier in March, ""He has shades of Rahul Gandhi of the past, prior to his Bharat Jodo Yatra avatar, when it comes to understanding the sensibilities of people. Look at what happened on the D-Day celebrations last month in France. He was at the functions at Normandy memorial and returned early to attend some television engagements, while his challenger from Labour Kier Starmer spent the whole day at the memorial. This sent a message across that the PM doesn\'t care much about the war heroes, some thing that the British people rate very highly. Goof ups like this show lack of political understanding and also highlight that he doesn\'t have able advisors around him.""\n\nSome of his staunchest supporters like former Metropolitan Police officer, Bhupender Singh, feel that he hushed up in calling the elections early.\n\nSunak should have waited for January 2025 and should have ensured that the planes to Rwanda with illegal immigrants have taken off. ""This would have silenced his critics who are gunning for him stating that he is soft on illegal migrants,"" says Singh.\n\nSingh admits Sunak is not on a strong wicket, but some like Kuldeep Singh\n\nShekhawat, founder of MA TV, says: ""Things now aren\'t that bad as they started,\n\nLabour minus any agenda and local seat dynamics in many parts of the country\n\naren\'t as strong as they started out. Let\'s wait for the results."" Shekhawat thrashes\n\nthe scepticism that Sunak might lose his seat Richmond, ""Anything is possible in\n\npolitics, but this is stretching too far. He will sail through.""\n\nWhile his supporters back him to the hilt, Sunak is pragmatic in his approach. Talking\n\nto the BBC on July 1, Sunak admitted that ""his party hasn\'t got everything right"" and\n\nhe wasn\'t too satisfied with the progress his government has made on reducing the\n\nNHS waiting lists. But like any other politician putting up a brave face he said: ""It\'s not\n\nover until it is over."" He fancies a flashy cover drive to finish the innings in style, but\n\nthat may be coming a little too late in his short, eventful innings.'"
402,402,"b'The Bharat Ratna awardee said that the young Congress leader may have faced some difficulty during his initial days in politics, but he has evolved over the years and his recent performance was \'extraordinarily good\'\n\nDescribing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi as a man who has ""significantly gained maturity"" over the years, Nobel laureate economist Professor Amartya Sen felt the leader\'s true test would be how he led the Opposition in Parliament during the current regime of Narendra Modi-led NDA government.\n\nThe nonagenarian also opined that Rahul\'s \'Bharat Jodo Yatra\' has not only shaped him as a national leader but also enriched the country\'s political landscape.\n\nTalking to PTI in an exclusive interview at his ancestral residence in Bolpur in West Bengal\'s Birbhum district, Sen recollected how Rahul, as a student at Trinity College in Cambridge, was unsure about ""what he wanted to do"" in life given that ""politics never quite appealed to him then"".\n\n""I think he (Rahul) is a much more mature person (now). I knew him as a young man during his days at Trinity College... the college where I studied and later became its Master. He (Rahul) visited me at that time and he came across as someone who was unclear about what he wanted to do. Politics didn\'t seem to appeal to him then,"" Sen recollected.\n\nThe Bharat Ratna awardee said that the young Congress leader may have faced some difficulty during his initial days in politics, but he has evolved over the years and his recent performance was ""extraordinarily good"".\n\n""Then he (Rahul) forayed into politics and I think initially he had some difficulty finding his feet. But his recent performance has been quite extraordinarily good and I am very admiring of that. Of course, you can\'t be fighting elections based on your qualities alone, it also depends on what the country is like,"" he stated.\n\nAsked whether he could see India\'s next Prime Minister in Rahul Gandhi, an amused Sen said that such possibilities are tough to predict.\n\n""I am not going to answer this thing (laughs). How people become prime ministers is very difficult to catch.\n\n""If somebody asked me when I was a student in Delhi, who among my fellow students was least likely to become a prime minister, I would have named Manmohan Singh since he did not seem to take any interest in politics. But then he went on to become a prime minister and, I think, an excellent one at that. So, it\'s difficult to predict these things,"" Sen smiled.\n\nReferring to Rahul\'s \'Bharat Jogo Yatra\' initiative, the academic extolled the Congress leader\'s ""improved ability of articulation"" in politics.\n\n""Rahul has done a good job. I think the yatra was good both for India and for him. And I think he has shown remarkable improvement in this ability to articulate, especially his thoughts on politics, much more clearly than he could in the past.\n\n""When he came to Trinity, he was possibly trying to be a development expert and we talked about what he should read and so on. He was very eloquent there, but in politics, not really. But now he is very articulate in matters of politics,"" he emphasised.\n\nAccording to Sen, the most significant change in Rahul\'s leadership quality comes from his newfound rootedness in the complexities of Indian polity which, he said, would be a boon both for the Congress party he leads and for the country in Parliament of which he is the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nSen concluded by highlighting the importance of Gandhi\'s role in addressing the pressing issues of inequality and sectarianism in India.\n\n""The most important issue is how he leads the Opposition in a country which has seen a great increase in inequality and sectarianism, particularly with respect to the majority community exercising overarching dominance over minorities like Muslims, Christians, and others. That\'s his primary role, and I think he\'s handling it well,"" Sen said.'"
403,403,"b'Rahul Gandhi holds up a copy of the Constitution as he takes oath as a member of the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. PTI picture\n\nThe Congress MP from Rae Bareli will be the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the 18th Lok Sabha. Rahul, who contested from two seats, has given up Wayanad that his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will contest.\n\nThe decision was announced late on Tuesday evening after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi sent a formal intimation to pro-tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab.\n\nFour days after the declaration of the Lok Sabha election results, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) had unanimously favoured Rahul as LoP in the Lok Sabha -- a post that has remained vacant for the past decade as no party had the necessary numbers for it.\n\nThe five-time MP had sought time to consider the CWC resolution urging him to become the LoP, which will pin him down in the capital when Parliament is in session.\n\nThere was the added consideration of how many INDIA bloc parties would accept his lead. Till now, INDIA meetings in Parliament have been happening in Rajya Sabha LoP Mallikarjun Kharge\'s office. Given his age and seniority, Kharge\'s leadership in this regard was easier to accept for parties such as the Trinamool Congress, which consistently maintains that it is not an electoral ally of the Congress.\n\nThe LoP in the Lok Sabha will not only have to carry the rest of the Opposition along, but will also be a member of various selection committees to pick heads of institutions such as the Lokpal, CBI, Central Vigilance Commission and the Central Information Commission along with the Prime Minister.\n\nAICC general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said the announcement on the other office-bearers in the Lok Sabha, including deputy leader and whips, would be made in due course.\n\n\'Bharat Jodo\' chants\n\nRahul took oath as a member of the Lok Sabha on Tuesday amid loud chants of ""Bharat Jodo"" as he held up a pocket edition of the Constitution with a red cover.\n\nOn Monday, Rahul had waved the same copy of the Constitution at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as they took oath.\n\nIt was widely expected that Rahul would be heckled in a tit-for-tat action, but the BJP members watched quietly as he took oath in English and signed off with the slogan ""Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhan (Constitution)"".\n\nOne possible reason could be that none of the top ministers or leaders was\n\npresent in the House to send out a signal to their flock to take on Rahul. Only one BJP member from the back rows was heard shouting something but by then Rahul had finished taking oath and was preparing to sign the House register.\n\nThe intensity and the punch of the ""Bharat Jodo"" chants and the thumping of desks mostly by Congress members appeared to be an effort to outdo the applause Modi had received a day earlier while taking oath. Rahul had undertaken two rounds of Bharat Jodo Yatra across the country and the Congress members appeared to be hailing him for it, seeking to link the party\'s improved poll performance to the Yatras.\n\nRahul was elected from two seats -- Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and Wayanad in Kerala -- and he has chosen to retain the former. Wayanad, vacated by him, will now be contested by his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.\n\nRahul sought to reach out to the ruling side too, though from a distance, and was seen greeting the members with folded hands after signing the House register. He not only shook hands with Faggan Singh Kulhaste, who was on the Chair as a member of the designated panel to assist pro-tem Speaker Bhartruhari Mahtab, but also some of the watch-and-ward staff of the House.\n\nRahul and many others, mostly Congress and Samajwadi Party members, took oath with a copy of the Constitution in hand. The oath-taking coincided with the 49th anniversary of the imposition of Emergency and Modi used it to slam the Congress in a series of posts on X. ""Those who imposed the Emergency have no right to profess their love for our Constitution,"" Modi wrote.\n\nBefore taking oath, Rahul was seen holding an intense discussion with Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, the party\'s second in command after Mamata Banerjee. The two sat in the front row and talked for nearly half an hour, joined by Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal. Rahul was seen repeatedly gesturing with his hand, possibly to emphasise his point as Abhishek listened quietly.\n\nIt was widely perceived that Rahul could be trying to seek the Trinamool Congress\'s support for K. Suresh\'s candidature for the Speaker\'s post. Trinamool is learnt to be upset for ""not being consulted"" before the Opposition decided to pit Suresh against the NDA\'s Om Birla. Trinamool has not signed Suresh\'s nomination papers.\n\nWednesday\'s election for the Speaker\'s post will make it clear whether Rahul has succeeded in securing Trinamool\'s support.'"

Their numbers are only projected to rise, from 77 lakhs in 2022 to about 2.4 crores in 2030. The ball is in the court of the Union Government. Hopefully the forthcoming Budget will take a step in this direction,"" Ramesh said.\n\nAccording to Karnataka\'s Labour department, the objectives of the proposed bill are ""to protect the rights of platform-based gig workers, to place obligations on aggregators in relation to social security, occupational health and safety, transparency in automated monitoring and decision-making systems and to provide dispute resolution mechanisms,"" among others.'"
